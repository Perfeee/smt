Afterward, all of the participants took a test psychologists often use to measure emotional intelligence: They're shown 36 pairs of eyes and are told to judge the emotion each pair is displaying.

No wonder the study subjects were better at reading human emotions when they'd just spent some time reading about human emotions.
