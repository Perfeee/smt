Take advantage of your existing school network and reach out to people who went to your school. These don't have to be people you knew very well, or even people that you have much in common with. Simply having gone to the same school is usually enough of an affiliation to compel another fellow alumni to speak with you.

While it is important to have confidence when pursuing job opportunities, it is also important to stay humble. It is important to be aware that you don't have much experience, and to be willing to take a job that you are not fond of. Your goal as a college graduate isn't necessarily to find your dream job that will propel you into a successful future--it's just to find a job to help you get started. Most jobs will provide a lot of value for you, in terms of teaching you about the world, and teaching you what it means to have a full-time job. Don't underestimate the importance and value of learning from a company what life is like. Moreover, after graduation it is unlikely that you will know exactly what you want to do.
