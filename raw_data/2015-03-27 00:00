{"article": ["There was great controversy as to the cause of the crash, which was investigated by two separate agencies independent of each other. The United States' National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) made a conclusion from its interpretation of the absent black box data, that the crash was the result of deliberate flight control inputs, most likely by the captain. However, the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) stated in its report that it could not determine a cause of the crash due to inconclusive evidence.\n\u6b64\u6b21\u5760\u673a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u5b58\u5728\u5de8\u5927\u4e89\u8bae\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u8c03\u67e5\u673a\u6784\u5404\u81ea\u72ec\u7acb\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u8c03\u67e5\u3002\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u8fd0\u8f93\u5b89\u5168\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u5bf9\u9ed1\u5323\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u505a\u51fa\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u673a\u957f\u7684\u84c4\u610f\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5760\u673a\u3002\u4f46\u5370\u5c3c\u56fd\u5bb6\u8fd0\u8f93\u5b89\u5168\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u58f0\u660e\u56e0\u7f3a\u5c11\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u4e8b\u6545\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "The cause of the crash was traced to the captain's deliberate engaging of the number 2 and 3 engines' thrust-reversers in flight.
