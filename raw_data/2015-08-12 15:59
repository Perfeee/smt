{"article": ["Food waste is a growing problem throughout the world; on one hand, we've got so many people starving or living in food insecurity, and on the other hand, in places like Western Europe or the US people are wasting almost 50% of what they eat. It seems rational to find ways to send the excess food to the places where it's most needed, but that doesn't happen nearly as much as it should. With that in mind, people in Galdakao, Spain, took initiative.\n\u5168\u7403\u7684\u98df\u7269\u6d6a\u8d39\u5f62\u52bf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u4e25\u5cfb\u3002\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u4eba\u4ecd\u7136\u5728\u6328\u997f\u6216\u8005\u6ca1\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u98df\u7269\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u897f\u6b27\u3001\u7f8e\u56fd\u7b49\u5730\u533a\u5403\u5269\u6d6a\u8d39\u7684\u98df\u7269\u8fd150%\u3002\u5bfb\u627e\u65b9\u6cd5\u628a\u591a\u4f59\u7684\u98df\u7269\u9001\u9001\u5230\u6700\u9700\u8981\u98df\u7269\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5408\u7406\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u5e76\u4e0d\u7ecf\u5e38\u53d1\u751f\u3002\u8003\u8651\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u52a0\u5c14\u8fbe\u8003\u7684\u4eba\u4eec\u79ef\u6781\u91c7\u53d6\u4e86\u884c\u52a8\u3002", "They launched what they call the Community Fridge \u2013 a regular white fridge placed in the middle of the town where anyone can drop food or leftovers and anyone can come in and take it.

A man in the Saudi city of Hail has also put a fridge outside his house and called on neighbors to fill it with food for the needy. However, in Yolo County, California, several University of California graduate students placed a community fridge on their lawn, sharing what they didn't need. People loved the idea and it worked just as it should, until the Yolo County Health Department caught wind of the experiment, they shut it down.
