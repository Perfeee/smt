Many other developing countries have also expressed similar strong wishes to China. The Asian Infrastructure Development Bank (AIIB) is established mainly as a response to the need of Asian countries for infrastructure development and their aspirations for further cooperation. According to the projection of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, from 2010 to 2020, the annual shortfall in funding for Asian infrastructural development is around US$800 billion. The AIIB serves as a new option to meet this shortfall, and it is therefore welcomed by both Asian countries and the wider international community. But as the funding shortage is huge, it is clear that the AIIB alone cannot possibly meet such demand. As an open and inclusive multilateral development agency, the AIIB will complement other multilateral development banks. In addition to Asian countries, countries outside Asia such as Germany, France and the U.K. have also joined the AIIB. China welcomes the U.S. to join the AIIB.

Starting from the Opium War in 1840, the Chinese nation went through a century of social turbulence, foreign aggression and the sufferings of war. Yet throughout all this trying time, our people stood on their feet and struggled tenaciously for a better future. They never gave up the longing for their cherished dream. To understand today's China, one needs to fully appreciate the Chinese nation's deep suffering since modern times and the profound impact of such suffering on the Chinese minds. That is why we regard the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as its greatest dream since modern times. The Chinese dream is as much the dream of every Chinese as it is the dream of the whole nation. It is not an illusion, nor is it an empty slogan.

If two big countries like ours do not cooperate with each other, just imagine what will happen to the world. Both history and reality show that China and the United States stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. When President Obama and I met at the Annenberg Estate, California, in the summer of 2013, we made the strategic decision of jointly building a new model of major-country relationship between China and the United States featuring nonconflict or confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. In the past two years and more since then, guided by this agreement, our exchanges and cooperation across the board have kept deepening and been upgraded. We maintain close and effective dialogue and cooperation on almost all major international and regional issues and global challenges. Facts have shown that the interests of China and the U.S. have grown increasingly intertwined.

The report released by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai showed that 95% of the surveyed businesses have planned to increase or maintain their investment in China.

The recent unusual fluctuations in the Chinese stock market were mainly the result of previous rapid surges and big fluctuations in the international market. The Chinese government has taken some measures to defuse systemic risks. Such steps have proved successful. As a matter of fact, similar steps have also been taken in some mature foreign markets.

Recent measures to improve the quotation of the RMB central parity is a case in point, as it gives greater say to the market in deciding the exchange rate. Given the complexities in the current international economic scene and financial market and the apparent divergence in market makers' expectations of the future trend of the RMB exchange rate, there had been a long-standing gap between the central parity and market exchange rate of the RMB. With improvements to the quotation of the RMB central parity, the RMB central parity will better respond to supply and demand in the foreign exchange markets, and systemically avert the sustained large gap between the RMB central parity and market exchange rate. Since the quotation of RMB central parity was improved on Aug. 11, initial progress has been made in correcting the deviation. Given the current economic and financial conditions at home and abroad, there is no basis for sustained depreciation of the RMB. Reform of the RMB exchange rate formation regime will continue in the direction of market operation.\n \u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\uff1a\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u5b8c\u5584\u4eba\u6c11\u5e01\u6c47\u7387\u5e02\u573a\u5316\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u6b21\u5b8c\u5584\u4eba\u6c11\u5e01\u6c47\u7387\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef7\u62a5\u4ef7\u5c31\u662f\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u52a0\u5927\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\u51b3\u5b9a\u6c47\u7387\u7684\u529b\u5ea6\u3002\u5f53\u524d\uff0c\u56fd\u9645\u7ecf\u6d4e\u91d1\u878d\u5f62\u52bf\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u505a\u5e02\u5546\u5bf9\u4eba\u6c11\u5e01\u6c47\u7387\u8d70\u52bf\u9884\u671f\u660e\u663e\u5206\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u4eba\u6c11\u5e01\u6c47\u7387\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef7\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u6c47\u7387\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u8f83\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u3002\u5b8c\u5584\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef7\u62a5\u4ef7\u4f7f\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef7\u5f62\u6210\u66f4\u52a0\u53c2\u8003\u5916\u6c47\u5e02\u573a\u4f9b\u6c42\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u673a\u5236\u4e0a\u9632\u6b62\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef7\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u6c47\u7387\u6301\u7eed\u5927\u5e45\u504f\u79bb\u30028\u670811\u65e5\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef7\u62a5\u4ef7\u5b8c\u5584\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u504f\u5dee\u77eb\u6b63\u5df1\u521d\u89c1\u6210\u6548\u3002\u4ece\u56fd\u9645\u56fd\u5185\u7ecf\u6d4e\u91d1\u878d\u5f62\u52bf\u770b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c11\u5e01\u6c47\u7387\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u8d2c\u503c\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u4eba\u6c11\u5e01\u6c47\u7387\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u6539\u9769\u4f1a\u7ee7\u7eed\u671d\u66f4\u52a0\u5e02\u573a\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u8fc8\u8fdb\u3002", "Chinaput forward the goal of convertibility of the RMB under the capital account back in the early 1990s.

This actually reflects improvement to the mix of local currency as well as foreign exchange assets and liabilities of domestic banks, enterprises and individuals. There are three main reasons: First, some assets in foreign exchanges were transferred from the central bank to domestic banks, enterprises and individuals, including an increase of US$56.9 billion in the balance of foreign reserve deposits of domestic banks in the first eight months of this year, with a US$27 billion increase in August alone. Second, outbound investment by domestic enterprises has grown rapidly. Third, domestic enterprises and other market entities are reducing foreign financing steadily, which helps reduce risks of high leverage operation and currency mismatch. These changes are normal capital flow, which is moderate and manageable. Foreign investors who aim at long-term gains are still investing in China.

The Party does not operate in a vacuum, so it has unavoidably found itself with problems of one kind or another. Corruption is just such a persistent one. The Party must be courageous enough to face up to the problem and go out to correct it through self-purification and self-rectification. Our people hate corruption more than anything else and we must act to allay their concerns. Therefore, we decided to go after both \u201ctigers and flies,\u201d wrongdoers regardless of their ranks. Since the the 18th CPC National congress, we have intensified anticorruption efforts, dealt with a large number of corrupt officials in accordance with law, including some who used to hold very high offices, and won extensive support and thumbs-up from the Chinese people.\n\n\u53cd\u8150\u8d25\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u56fd\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5171\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u6c11\u5fc3\u6240\u5411\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5b97\u65e8\u662f\u5168\u5fc3\u5168\u610f\u4e3a\u4eba\u6c11\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u6267\u653f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u662f\u4eba\u6c11\u62e5\u62a4\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u4fdd\u6301\u540c\u4eba\u6c11\u7fa4\u4f17\u7684\u8840\u8089\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u4e0d\u662f\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u771f\u7a7a\u4e2d\uff0c\u515a\u5185\u80af\u5b9a\u4f1a\u6709\u8fd9\u6837\u90a3\u6837\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8150\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\u5c31\u662f\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u987d\u75c7\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u6562\u4e8e\u76f4\u9762\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5584\u4e8e\u81ea\u6211\u51c0\u5316\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u9769\u65b0\u3002\u4eba\u6c11\u7fa4\u4f17\u6700\u75db\u6068\u8150\u8d25\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5fc5\u987b\u987a\u5e94\u6c11\u5fc3\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u8981\u201c\u8001\u864e\u201d\u3001\u201c\u82cd\u8747\u201d\u4e00\u8d77\u6253\u3002\u4e2d\u5171\u5341\u516b\u5927\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u52a0\u5927\u4e86\u53cd\u8150\u8d25\u6597\u4e89\u529b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f9d\u6cd5\u67e5\u5904\u4e86\u4e00\u5927\u6279\u8150\u8d25\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u67e5\u5904\u4e86\u66fe\u7ecf\u8eab\u5c45\u5f88\u9ad8\u804c\u4f4d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4eba\uff0c\u8d62\u5f97\u4e86\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u652f\u6301\u548c\u8d5e\u626c\u3002the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China", "On institutional building in this respect, let me share with you two remarks I made. The first is that we must keep power in the cage of systemic checks. The other one is, transparency is the best precaution against corruption. As we go further in the anticorruption campaign, we will focus more on institutional building so that officials will not dare and cannot afford to be corrupt and, more importantly, have no desire to take that course. Right now, we are formulating and updating relevant laws and regulations to truly put power inside a more closely-knit cage of effective checks. With respect to asset disclosure by officials, we adopted relevant regulations back in 2010 to require such reporting which was subject to random check and verification every year. The proportion of verified reporting has increased steadily, and no one would take exception. Should anyone be found to be dishonest, they will be punished accordingly.\n\n\u5173\u4e8e\u53cd\u8150\u8d25\u5236\u5ea6\u5efa\u8bbe\uff0c\u6211\u6709\u4e24\u53e5\u8bdd\uff0c\u4e00\u53e5\u662f\u201c\u628a\u6743\u529b\u5173\u8fdb\u5236\u5ea6\u7684\u7b3c\u5b50\u91cc\u201d\uff0c\u4e00\u53e5\u662f\u201c\u9633\u5149\u662f\u6700\u597d\u7684\u9632\u8150\u5242\u201d\u3002\u968f\u7740\u53cd\u8150\u8d25\u6597\u4e89\u5411\u7eb5\u6df1\u63a8\u8fdb\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8981\u7740\u529b\u5f62\u6210\u4e0d\u6562\u8150\u3001\u4e0d\u80fd\u8150\u3001\u4e0d\u60f3\u8150\u7684\u4f53\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u5b8c\u5584\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6cd5\u89c4\uff0c\u624e\u7ec6\u624e\u5bc6\u624e\u7262\u5236\u5ea6\u7684\u7b3c\u5b50\uff0c\u771f\u6b63\u628a\u6743\u529b\u5173\u8fdb\u5176\u4e2d\u3002\u5173\u4e8e\u5b98\u5458\u8d22\u4ea7\u516c\u5f00\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u57282010\u5e74\u5c31\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u5173\u89c4\u5b9a\uff0c\u5c06\u9886\u5bfc\u5e72\u90e8\u6536\u5165\u7b49\u6d89\u53ca\u8d22\u4ea7\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u5217\u5165\u4e2a\u4eba\u62a5\u544a\u4e8b\u9879\uff0c\u6bcf\u5e74\u5b9a\u671f\u62bd\u67e5\u6838\u5b9e\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u6838\u5b9e\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0d\u65ad\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u4eba\u90fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u4f8b\u5916\u3002\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5982\u5b9e\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u786c\u6027\u7684\u5904\u7406\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "I once said that the fight against corruption never ends.

With so much difference in ethnicity, history, culture, religion, social system, development level and lifestyle, there are things about others that one may find hard to understand. This is for sure, but that said, it is also true that anything that is seemingly incomprehensible can be understood provided that one is ready to learn and make an effort to understand it instead of dismissing it altogether. Every civilization, distinct and colorful as it is, possesses the value for its existence. A country or a nation should cherish and protect its own culture and values, and at the same time, recognize and respect those of others. While feeling proud of one's own cultural achievements, a country or a nation must not shut its door to the outside, still less, indulge in self-aggrandizement. As an old Chinese saying goes, \u201cLearning alone without exchanges with others will lead to ignorance.\u201d We should be ready to learn from other civilizations and carry forward their time-honored values that transcend national borders and retain appeal in modern times. China is ready to work with the U.S. and others in the international community with a view to seeking common progress through win-win cooperation, so as to deliver greater happiness to the Chinese people and ensure peace and development for the people around the world.\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u53e4\u4ee3\u601d\u60f3\u5bb6\u5b5f\u5b50\u8bf4\u8fc7\uff1a\u201c\u7269\u4e4b\u4e0d\u9f50\uff0c\u7269\u4e4b\u60c5\u4e5f\u3002\u201d\u56fd\u4e0e\u56fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u786e\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u4e0d\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u751f\u6d3b\u3002\u65e2\u7136\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7740\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6c11\u65cf\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u6587\u5316\u3001\u5b97\u6559\u3001\n\u5236\u5ea6\u3001\u53d1\u5c55\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u80af\u5b9a\u4f1a\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u76f8\u4e92\u4e0d\u90a3\u4e48\u597d\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e00\u5207\u770b\u4e0a\u53bb\u4e0d\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u90fd\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u7684\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u662f\u8981\u60f3\u53bb\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u52aa\u529b\u53bb\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u8981\u6392\u65a5\u3002\u4e30\u5bcc\u591a\u5f69\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u660e\u90fd\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u672c\u56fd\u672c\u6c11\u65cf\u8981\u73cd\u60dc\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u4e5f\u8981\u627f\u8ba4\u548c\u5c0a\u91cd\u522b\u56fd\u522b\u6c11\u65cf\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u6587\u5316\u3002\u5f3a\u8c03\u627f\u8ba4\u548c\u5c0a\u91cd\u672c\u56fd\u672c\u6c11\u65cf\u7684\u6587\u660e\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u8981\u641e\u81ea\u6211\u5c01\u95ed\uff0c\u66f4\u4e0d\u662f\u8981\u641e\u552f\u6211\u72ec\u5c0a\u3002\u201c\u72ec\u5b66\u800c\u65e0\u53cb\uff0c\u5219\u5b64\u964b\u800c\u5be1\u95fb\u3002\u201d\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u521b\u9020\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u6587\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u5e94\u8be5\u91c7\u53d6\u5b66\u4e60\u501f\u9274\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u628a\u8de8\u8d8a\u65f6\u7a7a\u3001\u8d85\u8d8a\u56fd\u5ea6\u3001\u5bcc\u6709\u6c38\u6052\u9b45\u529b\u3001\u5177\u6709\u5f53\u4ee3\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4f18\u79c0\u6587\u5316\u7cbe\u795e\u5f18\u626c\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u613f\u540c\u5305\u62ec\u7f8e\u56fd\u5728\u5185\u7684\u56fd\u9645\u793e\u4f1a\u4e00\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u8c0b\u5171\u8d62\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u4f5c\u4e2d\u540c\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\n\u8ba9\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u66f4\u52a0\u5e78\u798f\uff0c\u8ba9\u4e16\u754c\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u5e73\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u6210\u679c\u3002", "In today's world, it is impossible for China to develop on its own;
