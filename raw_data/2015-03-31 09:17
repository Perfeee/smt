He found that homework had a more positive impact on students as they aged, and identified stronger correlations between homework and achievement for students in grades seven through 12 than for students in kindergarten through sixth grade.1989\u5e74\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u54c8\u91cc\u65af\u00b7\u5e93\u73c0\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u5f71\u54cd\u6df1\u8fdc\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5e74\u9f84\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u505a\u5bb6\u5ead\u4f5c\u4e1a\u80fd\u8ba9\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u5b66\u4e1a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u4e0e\u4e0d\u505a\u5bb6\u5ead\u4f5c\u4e1a\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u5bb6\u5ead\u4f5c\u4e1a\u7684\u9ad8\u5e74\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u73b0\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u597d\u30022006\u5e74\uff0c\u5e93\u73c0\u53d1\u8868\u4e86\u53e6\u4e00\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e15\u5e74\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5bb6\u5ead\u4f5c\u4e1a\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5b66\u751f\u5e74\u9f84\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5bb6\u5ead\u4f5c\u4e1a\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u4f5c\u7528\u4f1a\u4e0d\u65ad\u663e\u73b0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e7\u5e74\u7ea7\u523012\u5e74\u7ea7\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5bb6\u5ead\u4f5c\u4e1a\u4e0e\u5b66\u79d1\u6210\u7ee9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8981\u6bd4\u5e7c\u513f\u56ed\u52306\u5e74\u7ea7\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u66f4\u52a0\u660e\u663e\u3002", "A 2012 study from the Indiana University School of Education on 10th-graders found little correlation between time spent on homework and better course grades, although it did find a positive correlation between homework time and standardized test performance.2012\u5e74\uff0c\u5370\u7b2c\u5b89\u7eb3\u5927\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u9662\u9488\u5bf910\u5e74\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bb6\u5ead\u4f5c\u4e1a\u65f6\u957f\u4e0e\u8bfe\u4e1a\u6210\u7ee9\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e76\u65e0\u5173\u8054\u3002\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u786e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bb6\u5ead\u4f5c\u4e1a\u65f6\u957f\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8003\u8bd5\u6210\u7ee9\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "Some parents of P.S. 116 students are not happy with the decision to eliminate homework.\u516c\u7acb116\u5c0f\u5b66\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5b66\u751f\u5bb6\u957f\u5bf9\u5b66\u6821\u53d6\u6d88\u5bb6\u5ead\u4f5c\u4e1a\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u6ee1\u3002", "\u201cI think they should have homework -- some of it is about discipline.
