Hoping to bite into what they thought was an energy bar, athletes instead got a mouthful of what turned out to be fruit-perfumed moisturising soap. Witnesses report many bars of soap, all with one bite missing, dumped at the roadside, and the problem appears to come from the fact that the soap packaging was written in English, which many runners did not understand, the paper's Chinese-language report noted.\n\u636e\u300a\u4eba\u6c11\u65e5\u62a5\u300b\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u5357\u90e8\u5e7f\u4e1c\u7701\u6e05\u8fdc\u5e02\u4e3e\u529e\u7684\u9a6c\u62c9\u677e\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ea6\u67092\u4e07\u540d\u53c2\u8d5b\u8005\u5728\u5230\u8fbe\u7ec8\u70b9\u540e\u6536\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u793c\u5305\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u4ee5\u4e3a\u662f\u80fd\u91cf\u68d2\uff0c\u4e00\u53e3\u54ac\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5634\u91cc\u5168\u662f\u6c34\u679c\u9999\u7682\u7684\u5473\u9053\u3002\u636e\u76ee\u51fb\u8005\u79f0\uff0c\u8def\u8fb9\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u88ab\u6254\u6389\u7684\u9999\u7682\u5757\uff0c\u90fd\u88ab\u54ac\u4e86\u4e00\u53e3\u3002\u300a\u4eba\u6c11\u65e5\u62a5\u300b\u7684\u4e2d\u6587\u62a5\u9053\u79f0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u9999\u7682\u7684\u5305\u88c5\u7eb8\u4e0a\u5199\u7684\u662f\u82f1\u6587\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u53c2\u8d5b\u8005\u770b\u4e0d\u61c2\u3002", "The organisers of the race were quick to apologise. \"The packs of soap were indeed like food packaging.
