{"article": ["Albert Einstein is perhaps the world's greatest scientist. The Nobel Prize winner, who solved the riddle of the photoelectric effect and proposed the general theory of relativity, died on April 18, 1955, aged 76 after laying the foundation of modern physics and changing mankind's views on space, time, mass, and energy. But did you know he was obsessed by fried eggs? That's one of 10 quirky things about the man behind the famous equation E = mc 2 that we learn from the book Einstein at Home, which will be published in English in May 2016 for the first time. The book contains five interviews conducted by scientist Friedrich Herneck with Herta Waldow, n\u00e9e Schiefelbein, who was the live-in housekeeper of Einstein in the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district of Berlin for six years.\n\u963f\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u2022\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u4f1f\u5927\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u3002\u4ed6\u662f\u8bfa\u8d1d\u5c14\u5956\u5f97\u4e3b\uff0c\u7834\u89e3\u4e86\u5149\u7535\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\uff0c\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u3002\u4ed6\u4e8e1955\u5e744\u670818\u65e5\u901d\u4e16\uff0c\u4eab\u5e7476\u5c81\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4f60\u77e5\u9053\u4ed6\u5bf9\u714e\u86cb\u975e\u5e38\u75f4\u8ff7\u5417\uff1f\u6211\u4eec\u4e5f\u662f\u4ece\u300a\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u751f\u6d3b\u300b\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u63d0\u51fa\u8457\u540d\u7b49\u5f0fE = mc 2\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u670910\u4e2a\u7656\u597d\uff0c\u90fd\u6536\u5f55\u5728\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u4e2d\u3002\u6b64\u4e66\u7684\u82f1\u6587\u7248\u5c06\u4e8e2016\u5e745\u6708\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u51fa\u7248\u3002\u4e66\u4e2d\u8fd8\u6536\u5f55\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5f17\u91cc\u5fb7\u91cc\u5e0c\u2022\u8d6b\u5c14\u5185\u514b\u5bf9\u8d6b\u5854\u2022\u6c83\u5c14\u591a\uff08\u5a18\u5bb6\u59d3\u5e2d\u8d39\u5c14\u62dc\u56e0\uff09\u5973\u58eb\u7684\u4e94\u6b21\u91c7\u8bbf\uff0c\u6c83\u5c14\u591a\u5973\u58eb\u66fe\u7ecf\u5728\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u4f4d\u4e8e\u67cf\u6797\u590f\u6d1b\u6ed5\u5821-\u5a01\u5c14\u9ed8\u65af\u591a\u592b\u533a\u7684\u5bb6\u4e2d\u5f53\u4e86\u516d\u5e74\u7684\u4f4f\u5bb6\u7ba1\u5bb6\u3002", "Einstein's second wife was his cousin Elsa Loewenthal.
