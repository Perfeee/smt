{"article": ["Resolving the Taiwan issue and realizing the complete reunification of China is a sacred and historic mission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese government. With an accurate understanding of overall trends in cross-Straits relations, and on the basis of maintaining the consistency of the policy on Taiwan, the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping as General Secretary has made a series of important statements on the Taiwan issue and the Taiwan-related initiatives of the mainland since the convening of the Eighteenth National Congress of the CPC in 2012. These statements, which embody a host of insightful new concepts, viewpoints, and requirements, have led to important new developments in our Taiwan-related initiatives and enriched policy guidelines of the CPC Central Committee on Taiwan. In this sense, we may say that they constitute an action plan for our Taiwan-related initiatives under new circumstances.\u89e3\u51b3\u53f0\u6e7e\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u7956\u56fd\u5b8c\u5168\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u795e\u5723\u5386\u53f2\u4f7f\u547d\u3002\u515a\u7684\u5341\u516b\u5927\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u540c\u5fd7\u4e3a\u603b\u4e66\u8bb0\u7684\u515a\u4e2d\u592e\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u53f0\u5de5\u4f5c\u5927\u653f\u65b9\u9488\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u628a\u63e1\u4e24\u5cb8\u5173\u7cfb\u53d1\u5c55\u5927\u52bf\uff0c\u5c31\u53f0\u6e7e\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5bf9\u53f0\u5de5\u4f5c\u53d1\u8868\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u91cd\u8981\u8bba\u8ff0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bb8\u591a\u5bcc\u6709\u521b\u89c1\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u5ff5\u65b0\u89c2\u70b9\u65b0\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5f15\u9886\u5bf9\u53f0\u5de5\u4f5c\u53d6\u5f97\u65b0\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u4e2d\u592e\u5bf9\u53f0\u65b9\u9488\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u505a\u597d\u65b0\u5f62\u52bf\u4e0b\u5bf9\u53f0\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u6307\u5357\u3002", "I.

The Chinese Dream we speak of today is a vivid expression of these long-cherished national wishes. The Chinese Dream is tied closely to the future of Taiwan. In order to make the shared Chinese Dream a reality as soon as possible, people on both sides of the Straits should stand by each other, devoting themselves to the rejuvenation of the nation regardless of their party affiliation, social strata, religion, and place of origin.

This foundation is the anchor of cross-Straits relations: only when it has been set firmly in place will cross-Straits relations be able to stay steady in the face of any storm.

As he has pointed out, this notion of one family is rooted in our blood and ethos, and in our common history and culture. All compatriots in Taiwan are our dear kin, regardless of which province or ethic group they hail from. Our compatriots in Taiwan have their own mentality as a result of their historical suffering and social environment, and we completely understand how they feel.

With a keen awareness of weak areas in cross-Straits economic cooperation, Xi Jinping, through his important statements, has pointed out the direction for improvement in our Taiwan-related work.\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u603b\u4e66\u8bb0\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bba\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e24\u5cb8\u540c\u80de\u73b0\u5b9e\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u4e24\u5cb8\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ea4\u6d41\u5408\u4f5c\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u8ba4\u8bc6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u628a\u63e1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u613f\u610f\u7ee7\u7eed\u4e3a\u53f0\u6e7e\u540c\u80de\u8c0b\u798f\u7949\u7684\u51b3\u5fc3\u548c\u8bda\u610f\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5bf9\u53f0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\u548c\u52aa\u529b\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u603b\u4e66\u8bb0\u63d0\u51fa\u8981\u7167\u987e\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u3001\u6269\u5927\u4e24\u5cb8\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u53d7\u76ca\u9762\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e24\u5cb8\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5408\u4f5c\u8fdb\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6709\u5f85\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e4b\u5904\u7684\u654f\u9510\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u6539\u8fdb\u5de5\u4f5c\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "VI.

As a consequence, there are certain matters on which their views differ quite considerably. In recent years, some Taiwan compatriots have shown growing concern over the rapid advancement of cross-Straits relations, and become increasingly complex and sensitive in their attitude. In light of this situation, there is a need for compatriots on both sides to strengthen mutual understanding and trust. Xi Jinping once said, \"Advancing the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations remains a long-term and arduous task, one that calls for deeper mutual trust on both sides. As long as there is mutual trust between compatriots, many difficult problems can be resolved with ease.\" Active efforts are therefore needed to facilitate broader contact between people of all circles and walks of life on both sides of the Straits. Through face to face interactions and heart to heart exchanges, we will be able to further mutual understanding and shorten the distance between us. Xi Jinping has placed a particular emphasis on contact between people at the grass-roots level and youths on both sides of the Straits. He has stressed that all Taiwan compatriots, especially ordinary people, should be able to benefit more from the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations. Youths hold the key to the future of cross-Straits relations. We need to work out more ways of facilitating interactions and contact between young people on both sides of the Straits, ensuring that they recognize the trend of peaceful development across the Straits and that they feel the momentum behind the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. This will put them in the position to shoulder the responsibility of opening up a new chapter in cross-Straits relations and making the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation a reality.\u8fd1\u767e\u5e74\u6765\u4e24\u5cb8\u540c\u80de\u805a\u5c11\u79bb\u591a\uff0c\u5f7c\u6b64\u4e4b\u95f4\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u5c3d\u76f8\u540c\u3002\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u53f0\u6e7e\u540c\u80de\u5bf9\u4e24\u5cb8\u5173\u7cfb\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5fe7\u8651\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u5fc3\u6001\u590d\u6742\u654f\u611f\u3002\u9762\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u540c\u80de\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e94\u52a0\u5f3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u603b\u4e66\u8bb0\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u201c\u4e24\u5cb8\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5e73\u53d1\u5c55\u4efb\u91cd\u9053\u8fdc\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u52a0\u6df1\u4e24\u5cb8\u540c\u80de\u76f8\u4e92\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u540c\u80de\u6709\u4e86\u4e92\u4fe1\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u96be\u9898\u5c31\u5bb9\u6613\u627e\u5230\u89e3\u51b3\u529e\u6cd5\u201d\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8981\u79ef\u6781\u521b\u9020\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u4e24\u5cb8\u793e\u4f1a\u5404\u754c\u5404\u9636\u5c42\u6c11\u4f17\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u9762\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u9762\u6c9f\u901a\uff0c\u5fc3\u4e0e\u5fc3\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u8fdb\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u62c9\u8fd1\u5fc3\u7406\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u603b\u4e66\u8bb0\u5c24\u5176\u5173\u5fc3\u4e24\u5cb8\u57fa\u5c42\u6c11\u4f17\u548c\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8981\u8ba9\u5e7f\u5927\u53f0\u6e7e\u540c\u80de\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u5c42\u6c11\u4f17\u90fd\u80fd\u66f4\u591a\u4eab\u53d7\u5230\u4e24\u5cb8\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5e73\u53d1\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002\u4e24\u5cb8\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u8eab\u4e0a\u5bc4\u6258\u7740\u4e24\u5cb8\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u8981\u591a\u60f3\u4e9b\u529e\u6cd5\uff0c\u591a\u521b\u9020\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8ba9\u4ed6\u4eec\u591a\u6765\u5f80\u3001\u591a\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u611f\u609f\u5230\u4e24\u5cb8\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5e73\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6f6e\u6d41\uff0c\u611f\u609f\u5230\u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\u4f1f\u5927\u590d\u5174\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4ee5\u540e\u80fd\u591f\u62c5\u5f53\u8d77\u5f00\u62d3\u4e24\u5cb8\u5173\u7cfb\u524d\u666f\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c11\u65cf\u4f1f\u5927\u590d\u5174\u7684\u91cd\u4efb\u3002"], "chinese_title": "\u52aa\u529b\u63a8\u52a8\u4e24\u5cb8\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5e73\u53d1\u5c55\u6210\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u963b\u6321\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6f6e\u6d41", "english_title": "Making the Peaceful Development of Cross-Straits Relations an Unstoppable Historical Trend", "time": "2015-11-08 09:01"}
