With an accurate understanding of overall trends in cross-Straits relations, and on the basis of maintaining the consistency of the policy on Taiwan, the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping as General Secretary has made a series of important statements on the Taiwan issue and the Taiwan-related initiatives of the mainland since the convening of the Eighteenth National Congress of the CPC in 2012. These statements, which embody a host of insightful new concepts, viewpoints, and requirements, have led to important new developments in our Taiwan-related initiatives and enriched policy guidelines of the CPC Central Committee on Taiwan. In this sense, we may say that they constitute an action plan for our Taiwan-related initiatives under new circumstances.", "I. Making joint efforts to realize the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation", "As a major strategic concept introduced by China's new central leadership, the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation is a common goal shared by people from all of China\u2019s ethnic groups and a banner under which all Chinese people around the world can unite. As Xi Jinping has emphasized, \"The Chinese Dream is the dream of people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, and it will take the joint efforts of us all to make it a reality.\" The rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the strength and prosperity of the country, and the wellbeing of the people \u2013 these are the long-cherished wishes of Sun Yat-sen, of all CPC members, and of all Chinese people since the advent of modern times. The Chinese Dream we speak of today is a vivid expression of these long-cherished national wishes. The Chinese Dream is tied closely to the future of Taiwan. In order to make the shared Chinese Dream a reality as soon as possible, people on both sides of the Straits should stand by each other, devoting themselves to the rejuvenation of the nation regardless of their party affiliation, social strata, religion, and place of origin. Developing peaceful cross-Straits relations hand in hand and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation together should be the central theme in cross-Straits relations, and a common mission shared by people on both sides of the Straits.", "In keeping with the important statements made by Xi Jinping, it is important that we view and plan our Taiwan-related initiatives from the perspective of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Bearing in mind that the Chinese Dream is closely connected to the future and destiny of people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, we need to make continued efforts to promote peaceful cross-Straits relations. By holding high the banner of the Chinese Dream and rallying as many people as possible from all walks of life in Taiwan, we need to assemble a \"Dream Team\" of compatriots spanning the Straits, so that people on both sides can participate in the Chinese Dream and work together for its realization.", "II. Working to promote peaceful cross-Straits relations", "Thanks to a series of major advances in recent years, a new chapter of peaceful development has been opened up in cross-Straits relations. However, the foundations of this peaceful development are still weak. More problems and obstacles have surfaced and separatist forces advocating \"Taiwan independence\" remains a real threat to peace in the Taiwan Straits. As Xi Jinping has stated, \"We welcome more Taiwan compatriots to join the effort to promote peaceful cross-Straits relations. Let us make concerted efforts, contribute ideas, figure out solutions, and pool wisdom and strength, so as to consolidate and expand the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, and make peaceful development into an irreversible historic trend.\" Xi Jinping has also stressed that both sides of the Straits should consolidate the common foundation of adhering to the \"1992 Consensus\" and opposing \"Taiwan independence,\" deepening the common understanding of safeguarding the One-China Framework. This foundation is the anchor of cross-Straits relations: only when it has been set firmly in place will cross-Straits relations be able to stay steady in the face of any storm. We treat all our compatriots in Taiwan as equals, and extend our welcome to all those who are willing to promote peaceful cross-Straits relations, regardless of what views they may have held in the past. As Xi Jinping has made clear, our policy of advancing the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations will not change; our practical initiatives to promote mutually beneficial exchanges and cooperation between the two sides of the Straits will not cease; our sincere desire to unite Taiwan compatriots in a common endeavor will not diminish; and our determination to deter the separatist attempts of \"Taiwan independence\" will not waver.", "III. Advocating the notion that \"both sides of the Taiwan Straits are one family\"", "Chinese people living on both sides of the Taiwan Straits are members of the same family, sharing ties of blood and a common destiny. The emergence of large-scale exchanges in a wide range of sectors across the Straits has come as an excellent opportunity for people on both sides to further mutual understanding and strengthen ties of kinship. Xi Jinping\u2019s statement that \"both sides of the Taiwan Straits are one family\" represents the most vivid expression of kinship among compatriots. As he has pointed out, this notion of one family is rooted in our blood and ethos, and in our common history and culture. All compatriots in Taiwan are our dear kin, regardless of which province or ethic group they hail from. Our compatriots in Taiwan have their own mentality as a result of their historical suffering and social environment, and we completely understand how they feel. We respect the social system and lifestyle they have chosen. Moreover, we are willing to use kinship to heal the wounds inflicted on Taiwan compatriots by history, and work together with them to build a bright future for the Chinese nation. To enable people in Taiwan to benefit more from the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, Xi Jinping has stressed that we must do our utmost to carry out any initiative that will help to improve the wellbeing of Taiwan compatriots, advance the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, and safeguard the overall interests of the Chinese nation.", "By approaching the past and present of cross-Straits relations in an objective and rational manner, and putting ourselves in the position of Taiwan compatriots so as to understand their mentality and feelings, Xi Jinping has shown true understanding and care for Taiwan compatriots, and sought to bring together the sentiments and hearts of compatriots on both sides of the Straits through his important statements, thus demonstrating that our Taiwan-related initiatives are founded on the principle of putting people first. With a strong emotional appeal, Xi's statements have become important principles guiding us as we seek to reach out to people in Taiwan.", "IV. Gradually creating favorable conditions for resolving inherent political differences between the two sides of the Straits", "In recent years, we have made remarkable achievements in cross-Straits dialogue by adhering to the principles of \"addressing easier issues before difficult ones, economic issues before political ones, and progressing on a step-by-step basis.\" However, ingrained conflicts and political differences that have long existed between the two sides have continued to hinder the growth of mutual political trust, holding back further enhancements in the depth and breadth of cross-Straits relations. In the words of Xi Jinping, \"Looking to the future, the long-existing political differences between the two sides must eventually be resolved. We cannot keep on passing these problems down from one generation to the next.\" Chinese people on both sides of the Straits have the wisdom to find a solution to these problems. Working within the One-China Framework, we are ready to engage in equal consultations with the Taiwan side in order to arrive at fair and reasonable arrangements. For matters requiring attention in cross-Straits relations, the heads of the competent departments on both sides may exchange opinions face to face.", "Xi Jinping's important statements have demonstrated our resolve and sincerity to find solutions to political problems between the two sides of the Straits. At the same time, they have demonstrated our willingness to advance dialogue between the two sides of the Straits, build up consensus, and create conditions for the resolution of problems. For example, in an effort to implement the guiding principles of Xi Jinping's important speeches, we were able to facilitate mutual visits between the heads of departments overseeing cross-Straits relations on both sides of the Straits during the first half of 2014, which led to the establishment of a permanent mechanism for communications between these two departments. As Xi has commented, the meeting of officials in charge of cross-Straits affairs has helped to establish common ground that will have positive implications for the comprehensive development of cross-Straits relations in the future.", "V. Deepening economic cooperation between the two sides of the Straits and sharing development opportunities with Taiwan compatriots", "The reform, opening up, and continued development on the Chinese mainland have not only provided opportunities for global development; they have also created a strong driving force and considerable potential for economic integration across the Taiwan Straits. As Xi has pointed out, \"We are willing to let Taiwan compatriots be the first to share the Chinese mainland's development opportunities.\" Proceeding on this basis, we will ascertain the actual needs of people in Taiwan, especially ordinary people, and take effective measures to benefit vulnerable groups so that more people in Taiwan can gain from economic exchanges and cooperation across the Straits. At the same time, we hope that high-level economic dialogue and coordination between the two sides can be further stepped up in an endeavor to take economic cooperation across the Straits to a new level. This will involve a range of efforts to accelerate the expansion of cooperation in industry, increase two-way investment, deepen cooperation in financial services, and explore new approaches to cooperation. In response to the interest that people in Taiwan have shown towards regional economic cooperation, Xi Jinping has suggested that the two sides may, at the right juncture and through pragmatic exchanges, explore appropriate and viable means of linking common economic development to the process of regional economic cooperation, so as to inject new vitality into cross-Straits economic cooperation.", "The important statements Xi has made have indicated a deep and accurate understanding of the needs of compatriots on both sides of the Straits, and of the underlying laws governing economic exchanges and cooperation between the two sides. In addition to demonstrating a sincere commitment to working for the wellbeing of Taiwan compatriots, they have highlighted the focus and orientation of our economic initiatives concerning Taiwan. Xi Jinping has also asserted that emphasis should be placed on catering to the interests of disadvantaged people in Taiwan and bringing the benefits of economic cooperation across the Straits to a broader spectrum of people. With a keen awareness of weak areas in cross-Straits economic cooperation, Xi Jinping, through his important statements, has pointed out the direction for improvement in our Taiwan-related work.", "VI. Building mutual trust between compatriots and fostering stronger ties between youths on both sides of the Straits", "Over the past century, compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits have spent more time apart than they have together. As a consequence, there are certain matters on which their views differ quite considerably. In recent years, some Taiwan compatriots have shown growing concern over the rapid advancement of cross-Straits relations, and become increasingly complex and sensitive in their attitude. In light of this situation, there is a need for compatriots on both sides to strengthen mutual understanding and trust. Xi Jinping once said, \"Advancing the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations remains a long-term and arduous task, one that calls for deeper mutual trust on both sides. As long as there is mutual trust between compatriots, many difficult problems can be resolved with ease.\" Active efforts are therefore needed to facilitate broader contact between people of all circles and walks of life on both sides of the Straits. Through face to face interactions and heart to heart exchanges, we will be able to further mutual understanding and shorten the distance between us. Xi Jinping has placed a particular emphasis on contact between people at the grass-roots level and youths on both sides of the Straits. He has stressed that all Taiwan compatriots, especially ordinary people, should be able to benefit more from the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations. Youths hold the key to the future of cross-Straits relations. We need to work out more ways of facilitating interactions and contact between young people on both sides of the Straits, ensuring that they recognize the trend of peaceful development across the Straits and that they feel the momentum behind the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. This will put them in the position to shoulder the responsibility of opening up a new chapter in cross-Straits relations and making the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation a reality.", "This Is The Cutest Way To Thank Another Driver On The Road", "There's enough road rage in the world; it's time to spread some smiles.", "Now there's MotorMood, a little light-up smiley face that goes on your car's rear window and lets you say \"thanks\" to other drivers.

The Nobel Prize winner, who solved the riddle of the photoelectric effect and proposed the general theory of relativity, died on April 18, 1955, aged 76 after laying the foundation of modern physics and changing mankind's views on space, time, mass, and energy. But did you know he was obsessed by fried eggs? That's one of 10 quirky things about the man behind the famous equation E = mc 2 that we learn from the book Einstein at Home, which will be published in English in May 2016 for the first time.

Elsa could not persuade Einstein to pay for a barber so she would cut his hair herself.

Waldow, who was the housekeeper from 1927-1933, said that he was always short of cash and his wife was very penny pinching. He wore shoes with holes in them, even if they were no longer watertight. \"He would wear them until it was no longer possible.\" She said his favourite footwear was sandals. No wonder he kept a sign up in his office in later life in Princeton that said: \"Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.\"", "Waldow had to deliver fried eggs and scrambled eggs almost every day for his breakfast. There were eggs for breakfast, usually fried. There was also a lot of honey, which we bought by the pail, brought by a beekeeper. \"Herr Professor always ate fried eggs, at least two.\" They bought their fresh eggs from an elderly Jewish man. \"Dear me, he was so grubby!\" Waldow said. Einstein also enjoyed mushrooms with his eggs. \"He would probably have eaten mushrooms three times a day, that's how fond he was of them.\"", "He would only eat steak if it was very well done. He would always say: \"I am not a tiger\". Einstein didn't like having his private remarks published and later wrote, \"it never occurred to me that every casual remark of mine would be snatched up and recorded. Otherwise I would have crept further into my shell.\"", "Einstein visited England in 1933 but wasn't much impressed with our cuisine, saying of English cooking, \"it's ghastly, they cook everything with mutton fat\".

Einstein was \"passionately fond of strawberries\" - he liked a strawberry dish served with whipped cream, together with what he called \"strawberry snow\".", "Einstein only drank caffeine-free coffee called Kaffee Haag and black tea.

But in China there seems to be a particular adherence to uniforms. From entering the subway, passing security and stepping onto the train, you will have encountered not one, but multiple uniformed staff. Walking down the street will have meant dodging bright orange street cleaners, food-delivery staff on scooters or identically dressed salon workers receiving their morning briefing. Upon entering your office, you may have passed uniformed security guards on your way to colleagues dressed in suits and ties. They\u2019re inescapable.", "The uniform's place in Chinese society can be traced back through the country\u2019s history. As in most places across the world, they have been worn throughout the ages in the military to distinguish between factions and provide protection. Each dynasty favored a different style for its soldiers. Drawings of soldiers from the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-221 B.C.) show studded boots and uniforms with heavy arm and torso protection, whereas similar depictions from the Sui Dynasty (A.D. 581-618) illustrate draped and layered military wear. Uniforms were often as fierce as the battles their wearers fought in.", "Uniforms were also designed to show status and mark levels of authority. In China, the Terracotta Warriors in Xi\u2019an were molded to wear styles commonly found in the Qin Dynasty (221-207 B.C.). Officers' ranks were discernible by their dress, with generals wearing a dual long jacket, long pants, thigh protectors, a crest hat and a pair of boots with square tips.", "But at points throughout history, uniforms were deemed fashion items too. Zhongshan suits (Chinese tunic suits, above) were hugely popular among males in 1950s, with women\u2019s clothing based on a similar style. Introduced by Sun Yat-Sen and made famous by Mao Zedong who favored it in public, hence the nickname \u2018Mao suit\u2019, the clothing became a form of national dress.", "In the military, clothing now follows the generic western style of pants, jacket and a hat. The Zhongshan suit has also undergone modernization. With an altered shape and more streamlined look, the once shapeless garment is now fitted and more flattering for the male body. But while it is still a popular choice for Chinese leaders during important events, tunic suits are rarely seen in wider society.", "Yet, there are many places where uniforms live on. This is the case in the hospitality industry in particular, explains Catalina Calin, director of Calin Fashion Academy in Beijing.", "\u201cIn Europe, you don\u2019t see uniforms that often [compared to China]. Hospitality is the one industry that is still using them because they can project the type of service or professionalism that you are expecting,\u201d she says. \u201cA uniform is very important for how a client sees you, but it\u2019s also important for how the employee is feeling. The uniform has to be fitted right for the person to feel confident and beautiful.\u201d\n\u201c", "Calin believes there will be more emphasis on uniforms\u2019 appearance in the future: \u201cChinese ladies are starting to become more conscious of their appearance and beauty. This flows through to the places they work, which have to fit their needs,\u201d she says, citing staff the New World Hotel\u2019s Yin on 12 bar as an example of progression. \u201cThey wear short black skirts, rock-style shoes and dark make-up. This brings a very cool image to the bar.\u201d\nCalin", "But China\u2019s love affair with uniforms stretches far beyond hospitality. While there is no single explanation for this, it may reflect a more inherently collectivist culture, where self-identity is shaped by group memberships. In the workplace, or in schools, people feel a stronger sense of self if they are able to define themselves as part of a group.", "On the streets of Beijing, the way people feel about wearing uniforms varies wildly. Outside Ginza Mall we find Xing (above), a safety officer from Shanxi, wearing a dark blue-black shirt, pants and hat. \u201cI feel like a soldier when I wear my uniform,\u201d he declares, demonstrating an army-like pose. \u201cIt makes me feel like I\u2019m part of a team. I like all of it.\u201d", "But not all are so positive about their work clothes. Zhao (below left), a 55-year-old former architect from Zhangjiakou, has been a cleaner around Dongzhimen for half a year.

The latter\u2019s dress may be down to practical considerations, such as the heavy traffic in Dongzhimen and the need for greater visibility. But in the restaurant world, the style of uniform is largely dependent on the establishment\u2019s level of service and cuisine. High-end restaurants feature more of a classic style (shirt, pants) than those found in fast-food restaurants, for instance, which favor casual wear in the form of polos and tracksuits.", "Zhang (above left), a server at the popular Guijie restaurant Culiang Renjia, wears a floral-printed top-and-pant combination with simple black shoes and pigtailed hair. Apart from a faint resemblance to pajamas, the uniform is visually appealing, and it fits the restaurant\u2019s theme of nostalgia.", "\u201cI like my uniform because it\u2019s unique and looks nice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very comfortable.\u201d\n\u201c", "As in most countries, uniform wearing begins from a young age in China.

The style fulfills these criteria, but at what cost? As one online commentator bluntly assessed: \u201cThey are the ugliest in the world.\u201d", "This particular comment came after US First Lady Michelle Obama visited a Beijing high school in 2014 and photos from the trip were splashed across social media. Commentators pointed out that the tracksuit is practical and wear-resistant, though many expressed that other designs can fulfill the same goals.", "For students, as with adults, uniforms can increase the wearer\u2019s confidence. Some believe that more stylish school wear may help students perform better (or feel happier, at least). In April 2013, the Henan Provincial Experimental School in Zhengzhou decided to let students design their own uniforms.

The Origins of Halloween", "Halloween is thought to have originated around 4000 B.C., which means Halloween has been around for over 6,000 years as we know it today, borrow traditions from different festivals namely: the Roman feralia festival commemorating for dead, the roman Pomona festival honoring the goddess of fruit and trees, the Celtic festival Samuin, meaning \u201csummer's end\u201d, which comprise the bulk of origins of Halloween traditions, the Catholic Hallowmas period of \u201cAll soul's Day\u201d and All Saint's Day which was instigated around 800 by a church to try to replace Samuin.", "2. Color", "Black and orange are the international colors of Halloween. Black, of course, is a sign of death, gloom and the foreboding night, which are all associated with Halloween. Orange is a traditional emblem of fortitude, survival and power, which signify the harvest, and the colors of fall. Halloween is where death (winter) takes over from the life-giving fall harvest, hence the mixtures of black and orange come festival time.", "3. Costumes", "The custom of wearing costumes or masks comes from Celtic tradition of young men impersonating evil spirits, by dressing up in white costumes with blackened faces or masks in an attempt to placate these spirit.", "4. Trick or Treat", "Trick or Treating has a short history. In 19th century Scotland and Ireland, there is some records of children travelling door-to-door praying for souls or performing for money or cakes on All Hallows Eve. However, the tradition is a short step from the medieval practice of souling, in which beggars went door to door on October 31 to pray for souls in return for food. The food given was often a Soul Cake, which was a small round cake which represented a soul being freed from Purgatory when the cake was eaten. Today Trick or Treat means \u201cgives us a treat or we'll pull a prank on you\u201d.\n\u201c", "5. Jack O'Lanterns", "According to Irish legend, Jack O'Lanterns are named after a man named Jack. This crafty fellow fooled the devil on numerous occasions and, as a result, his soul was condemned to hang about Earth for all eternity. Jack, barred from both heaven and hell, put the burning ember given to him by Beelzebub into the very first \u201djack-o-lantern\u201d, in order to ward off any more encounters with the Evil one.", "6. Turnips Instead of Pumpkins", "The first Jack O'Lanterns were actually made from turnips by the Celts to ward off evil spirits during Samuin, The Celts would hollow out turnips then carve faces in them and place candles inside. The turnips were then either placed in the windows to keep evil spirits from encountering a home or carried around as lanterns. The tradition eventually melded with the North American tradition of carving pumpkins.", "Groom 'sues bride for trauma' sustained after he sees her bare-faced", "Make-up is meant to make people look better, but one new groom got such a shock about the bare-faced appearance of his bride that he is allegedly suing her for fraud.", "The anonymous man, who married his new wife in all her finery, apparently saw her in his room after the wedding and refused to believe that she was his wife without her make-up on.", "Reports from Algeria, where the marriage took place, have stated that the bride was never without her make-up before the big day.", "He was so stunned when he saw her face he reportedly said he thought she was \u201cthief who came to steal his apartment\u201d.", "A court source told Emirates 247: \u201cThe groom told the judge that he could not recognise his wife after she washed the make-up off her face.", "\u201cHe said he was deceived by her as she used to fill up her face with make-up before their marriage.\n\u201c", "\u201cHe said she looked very beautiful and attractive before their marriage, but when he woke up in the morning and found that she had washed the make-up off her face, he was frightened as he thought she was a thief.\n\u201c", "The groom is demanding \u00a313,000 damages for \"psychological suffering\".", "Kamikatsu \u2013 Japan\u2019s aspiring zero-waste town", "We\u2019ve heard many stories of individuals across the world who\u2019ve adopted a zero-waste lifestyle, but it\u2019s not often that we come across an entire community that is trying to become waste-free. The residents of Kamikatsu, Japan, take recycling so seriously that they actually hope to become the nation\u2019s first zero-waste community by 2020.", "Kamikatsu has no garbage trucks \u2013 so residents need to compost their kitchen scraps at home. They also have to wash and sort the rest of their trash into 34 different categories, and bring it to the recycling center themselves where workers make sure that the waste goes into the correct bins. It apparently took some time for the residents to get used to this rule, but they eventually managed to adapt to the drastic changes and are now seeing them as normal.", "The Japanese town has turned recycling into a streamlined process \u2013 there are separate bins for different types of paper products \u2013 newspapers, magazines, cartons, and flyers. Even plastic bottles and their caps go into different bins as do aluminum, spray, and steel cans are collected separately too. Many of these items are resold or repurposed into usable clothing, toys, and accessories. The labels on each bin show the recycling process for that specific item, so the residents know exactly what happens to their trash.", "Reuse is highly encouraged in Kamikatsu \u2013 they have a local kuru-kuru shop where residents can exchange used items with new things at no extra cost.

His stories are fables about human progress\u2014concretely imagined but abstract. Take the novella \"Sun of China,\" which follows Ah Quan, a young man from a rural village that has been impoverished by drought.

In \"The Wandering Earth,\" scientists discover that the sun is about to swell into a red giant. In response, they build enormous engines capable of pushing the entire planet toward another star\u2014an \"exodus\" that will last a hundred generations, during which everything on the surface will be destroyed. Watching the deadly sun recede and transform into a star like any other, the protagonist cries out, \"Earth, oh my wandering Earth!\" And yet the story suggests that this is just the sort of outrageous project we'll need in order to insure humanity's long-term survival.", "\"In the distant future, if human civilization survives and spreads through the cosmos, humanity must create technological marvels at ultra-grand scales,\" Liu wrote to me.", "I believe science and technology can bring us a bright future, but the journey to achieve it will be filled with difficulties and exact a price from us. Some of these obstacles and costs will be quite terrible, but in the end we will land on the sunlit further shore. Let me quote the Chinese poet Xu Zhimo from the beginning of the last century, who, after a trip to the Soviet Union, said, \"Over there, they believe in the existence of Heaven, but there is a sea of blood that lies between Heaven and Hell, and they\u2019ve decided to cross the sea.\"", "But to what end? Humanity can't survive everything; the last volume of the \"Three-Body\" trilogy is set, in part, during the heat-death of the universe. Liu\u2019s stories see life from two angles, as both a titanic struggle for survival and as a circumscribed exercise in finitude. In my favorite of his stories, \"The Mountain\"\u2014it's available in English in a short-fiction collection called \"The Wandering Earth\"\u2014mountain climbing is proposed as a metaphor for this contradiction. \"It is the nature of intelligent life to climb mountains,\" inter-dimensional alien explorers explain. But the universe is so unknowable that \"we are all always at the foot,\" and will never reach the peak. In another story, \"The Devourer,\" a character asks, \"What is civilization? Civilization is devouring, ceaselessly eating, endlessly expanding.\" But you can't expand forever; perhaps it would be better, another character suggests, to establish a \u201cself-sufficient, introspective civilization.\" At the core of Liu's sensibility, in short, is a philosophical interest in the problem of limits. How should we react to the inherent limitations of life? Should we push against them or acquiesce?", "\"Everything ends,\" Liu said, in his e-mail, \"and describing what is inevitable should not be viewed as a form of pessimism. Take the example of a romantic tale: 'The lovers lived happily ever after' would clearly be viewed as an optimistic story. But if you add a coda\u2014'A hundred years later, they were both dead'\u2014does that turn the story pessimistic?

Tangerines and Oranges", "Displaying and eating these fruits is said to bring wealth and luck.

Jai", "This vegetarian dish is eaten because it\u2019s \u201cpart of the Buddhist culture to cleanse yourself with vegetables,\u201d says Lum.

The observers rated the woman on a number of characteristics, but this time they also judged her suitability for the job and the pay she should receive. Observers of the luxury logo rated the woman most suitable for the job, again with significantly higher status and wealth ratings.

That is, watching good TV makes you more empathetic.", "In the paper, the authors describe two experiments that led them to their pro-TV conclusion. In one, they asked about 100 people to first watch either a television drama (Mad Men or The West Wing) or a nonfiction program (How the Universe Works or Shark Week: Jaws Strikes Back). Afterward, all of the participants took a test psychologists often use to measure emotional intelligence: They're shown 36 pairs of eyes and are told to judge the emotion each pair is displaying. The results showed that the people who'd watched the fictionalized shows did better on this test than those who watched the nonfiction ones.", "They tried this again, only switching up the programs (The Good Wife and Lost versus Nova and Through the Wormhole) and adding a control group, too: people who took the eye-reading test without watching any television first. Again, their results showed that the fiction viewers' empathy scores were superior, though the nonfiction viewers' scored higher on average than those who hadn't watched anything beforehand.", "It's a similar finding to a widely reported 2013 study that claimed that reading literary fiction is linked to better scores on this empathy-measuring test. The authors of that study and this new one argue that a complex fictional narrative forces the reader or viewer to consider a problem from multiple perspectives; further, since not every character's emotion is explicitly spelled out, the audience must do some mental work to fill in those gaps, making a guess at the inner lives of the character.", "That literary fiction study, however, was also widely critiqued for its methods. Specifically, the fiction the researchers chose for their study was by authors like Louise Erdrich or Anton Chekhov; the nonfiction, on the other hand, was one of three Smithsonian articles, with titles like \"How the Potato Changed the World.\" I mention this not to speak ill of delicious tubers (I would never do that), but to point out that the nonfiction samples they chose weren't about people. No wonder the study subjects were better at reading human emotions when they'd just spent some time reading about human emotions. And this new study falls short in a similar manner: Is it really that surprising that people might be in a more empathetic state of mind after trying to figure out what is going on in Don Draper's head than they would be after watching a Shark Week show?

It's change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away. It's change that can broaden opportunity, or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.", "America has been through big changes before \u2013 wars and depression, the influx of immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, and movements to expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those fears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the \"dogmas of the quiet past.\" Instead we thought anew, and acted anew. We made change work for us, always extending America's promise outward, to the next frontier, to more and more people. And because we did \u2013 because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril \u2013 we emerged stronger and better than before.", "What was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation \u2013 our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery and innovation, our diversity and commitment to the rule of law \u2013 these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.", "In fact, it's that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible. It's how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations. It's how we reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans, and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.", "But such progress is not inevitable. It is the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together?", "So let's talk about the future, and four big questions that we as a country have to answer \u2013 regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress.", "Let me start with the economy, and a basic fact: the United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. We're in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history. More than 14 million new jobs; the strongest two years of job growth since the '90s; an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever. Manufacturing has created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years. And we've done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.", "Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. What is true \u2013 and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious \u2013 is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit and haven't let up. Today, technology doesn't just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and face tougher competition. As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.", "All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs; even when the economy is growing. It's made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start on their careers, and tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.", "For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that works better for everybody. We've made progress. But we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments we've had these past few years, there are some areas where Americans broadly agree.", "We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we've increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, and boosted graduates in fields like engineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all, offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one, and we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.", "And we have to make college affordable for every American. Because no hardworking student should be stuck in the red. We've already reduced student loan payments to ten percent of a borrower's income. Now, we've actually got to cut the cost of college. Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I'm going to keep fighting to get that started this year.", "Of course, a great education isn't all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. After all, it's not much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package, for 30 years, are sitting in this chamber. For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, they may have to retool and retrain. But they shouldn't lose what they've already worked so hard to build.", "That's why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever; we shouldn't weaken them, we should strengthen them. And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That's what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It's about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we'll still have coverage. Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so far. Health care inflation has slowed. And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.", "Now, I'm guessing we won't agree on health care anytime soon. But there should be other ways both parties can improve economic security. Say a hardworking American loses his job \u2013 we shouldn't just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that's ready to hire him. If that new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he's going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That's the way we make the new economy work better for everyone.", "I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up, and I'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids.", "But there are other areas where it's been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years \u2013 namely what role the government should play in making sure the system's not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. And here, the American people have a choice to make.", "I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and there's red tape that needs to be cut. But after years of record corporate profits, working families won't get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everyone else; or by allowing attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food Stamp recipients didn't cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants aren't the reason wages haven't gone up enough; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It's sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts. In this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And this year I plan to lift up the many businesses who've figured out that doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers, and their communities, so that we can spread those best practices across America.", "In fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative. This brings me to the second big question we have to answer as a country: how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?", "Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny Sputnik was up there. We didn't argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.", "That spirit of discovery is in our DNA. We're Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. We're Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. We're every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better world. And over the past seven years, we've nurtured that spirit.", "We've protected an open internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. We've launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.", "But we can do so much more. Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources they've had in over a decade. Tonight, I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he's gone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past forty years, I'm putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. For the loved ones we've all lost, for the family we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.", "Medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.", "Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You'll be pretty lonely, because you'll be debating our military, most of America's business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it's a problem and intend to solve it.", "Seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal \u2013 in jobs that pay better than average. We're taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy \u2013 something environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. Meanwhile, we've cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly sixty percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.", "Gas under two bucks a gallon ain't bad, either.\n2", "Now we've got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future \u2013 especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. That's why I'm going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. That way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.", "None of this will happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs we'll create, the money we'll save, and the planet we'll preserve \u2013 that's the kind of future our kids and grandkids deserve.", "Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world. And that's why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there's a problem.", "I told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. It's not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined. Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that's the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead \u2013 they call us.", "As someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that's not because of diminished American strength or some looming superpower. In today's world, we're threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states. The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds blow from a Chinese economy in transition. Even as their economy contracts, Russia is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine and Syria \u2013 states they see slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.", "It's up to us to help remake that system. And that means we have to set priorities.", "Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks. Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today's world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country; they undermine our allies.", "But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence. That's the story ISIL wants to tell; that's the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We don't need to build them up to show that we're serious, nor do we need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is representative of one of the world's largest religions. We just need to call them what they are \u2013 killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.", "That's exactly what we are doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL's financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, and their weapons. We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.", "If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. But the American people should know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America's commitment \u2013 or mine \u2013 to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden. Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.", "Our foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can't stop there. For even without ISIL, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world \u2013 in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks; others will fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't pass muster on the world stage.", "We also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis. That's not leadership; that's a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us. It's the lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq \u2013 and we should have learned it by now.", "Fortunately, there's a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.", "That's our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we're partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.", "That's why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. As we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.", "That's how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our military, our doctors, and our development workers set up the platform that allowed other countries to join us in stamping out that epidemic.", "That's how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products Made in America, and supports more good jobs. With TPP, China doesn't set the rules in that region, we do. You want to show our strength in this century? Approve this agreement. Give us the tools to enforce it.", "Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America. That's why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, and positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people. You want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere? Recognize that the Cold War is over. Lift the embargo.", "American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world \u2013 except when we kill terrorists; or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security, not charity. When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change \u2013 that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our children. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend upon. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, that prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Right now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, and we have the capacity to accomplish the same thing with malaria \u2013 something I'll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.\n21", "That's strength. That's leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo: it's expensive, it's unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.", "That's why we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn't a matter of political correctness. It's a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith. His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that \"to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.\" When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn't make us safer. That's not telling it like it is. It's just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country.", "\"We the People.\"\n\u201c", "Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we've come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together. That brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important thing I want to say tonight.", "The future we want \u2013 opportunity and security for our families; a rising standard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids \u2013 all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates.", "It will only happen if we fix our politics.", "A better politics doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. This is a big country, with different regions and attitudes and interests. That's one of our strengths, too. Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.", "But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. It doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic. Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; or when even basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree with us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention. Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn't matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest.", "Too many Americans feel that way right now. It's one of the few regrets of my presidency \u2013 that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. There's no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.", "But, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task \u2013 or any President's \u2013 alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber who would like to see more cooperation, a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the demands of getting elected. I know; you've told me. And if we want a better politics, it's not enough to just change a Congressman or a Senator or even a President; we have to change the system to reflect our better selves.", "We have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around. We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families and hidden interests can't bankroll our elections \u2013 and if our existing approach to campaign finance can't pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution. We've got to make voting easier, not harder, and modernize it for the way we live now. And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do.", "But I can't do these things on my own. Changes in our political process \u2013 in not just who gets elected but how they get elected \u2013 that will only happen when the American people demand it. It will depend on you. That's what's meant by a government of, by, and for the people.", "What I'm asking for is hard. It's easier to be cynical; to accept that change isn't possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don't matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don't look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.", "We can't afford to go down that path. It won't deliver the economy we want, or the security we want, but most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.", "So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligations as a citizen. To vote. To speak out. To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us.

'It's like a hot frying pan in your pants.'", "In order to infuse the underwear with a bacon-y scent which would last beyond a first-time wear, the creators of the bacon-scented lingerie embedded the fragrance into the ink used in its design, a technology which was indeed first created by NASA.", "And according to Justin and Dave, the two men behind J&D's, the underwear's bacon scent 'will last through multiple wash cycles and wearings', with the website then adding a cheeky caveat that the length for which the aroma lasts 'depends on the number of wearings and the strength of your own scent'.", "The J&D's website also suggests that wearers wash their bacon-scented underwear, which retails for $19.99 a pair, with unscented detergent so as not to detract from the meaty scents with any other perfumes.\nJ&D's", "Unsurprisingly, many people took to social media to question the exact purpose of the porcine pants.", "'Apparently bacon-scented underwear is a thing now.

It is learned that both the royal family and the government of the UK attach great importance to your visit and are making meticulous preparations for it. You visited the UK in the 1990s and what was your impression then? What do you expect from your coming visit to the UK after more than 20 years? What will be its impact on China-UK relations and China-EU relations? Some Britons fear China's intentions and believe that the British government is too eager to please China. How do you ensure that China-UK relationship is mutually beneficial?", "A: I visited London, Oxford, Glasgow and Edinburgh in 1994. I was deeply impressed by the visit, particularly Britain's long history, unique culture, friendly people and its beautiful environment.", "During my upcoming state visit to the UK at the invitation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, I look forward to having discussions with British leaders and engaging the British public on our bilateral ties. I hope this will chart the course for the future growth of China-UK relations, inject new impetus in practical cooperation between our two countries in all fields and enable us to jointly usher in a \"golden time\" for China-UK comprehensive strategic partnership.", "Public opinion surveys conducted in Britain show that views of China are largely favorable among the British people. Our two peoples appreciate each other's time-honored and unique cultures. This is an important foundation and favorable condition for growing bilateral ties. It is true that some people have some misgivings about China-UK cooperation. What I want to stress is that in today's world, no country can afford to pursue development with its door closed. One should open the door, warmly welcome friends and be hospitable to them. This is recognized international practice. The UK has stated that it will be the Western country that is most open to China. This is a visionary and strategic choice that fully meets Britain's own long-term interest. China looks forward to engaging with the UK in a wider range, at a higher level and in greater depth.", "In recent years, while global growth has slowed down, China-UK investment and business cooperation has kept growing. The UK has become the EU's second largest investor in China as well as China's second largest trading partner and investment destination in the EU. China has been the UK's second largest non-EU trading partner. In 2014, China-UK trade volume for the first time exceeded 80 billion U.S. dollars, and China's import from the UK has doubled in five years. Two-way investment between China and the UK has grown rapidly. China's investment in the UK has risen at an annual rate of 71.7 percent over the past three years. Last year, the UK investment in China increased by 87.6 percent year-on-year, the fastest among major EU countries.", "The British government has introduced ambitious plans on upgrading infrastructure, building the Northern Powerhouse in the north of England and implementing the strategy of UK Industry 2050. These plans and the \"Road and Belt Initiative\" and the initiatives of \"Made in China 2025\" and \"Internet Plus\" undertaken by China complement each other in many ways. China is ready to partner with the UK in the spirit of inclusiveness, opening up and seeking win-win progress through cooperation to upgrade and expand cooperation to deliver more benefits to our two peoples.", "This year marks the beginning of the second decade of the China-UK comprehensive strategic partnership and the 40th anniversary of China-EU diplomatic ties. Both China-UK relationship and China-EU relationship face important opportunities to build on past success for new progress. Since the UK is an important member of the EU, China-UK relationship and China-EU relationship reinforce each other. During my visit to the EU Headquarters last year, EU leaders and I agreed to build China-EU partnership of peace, growth, reform and civilization. I believe new progress in China-UK relationship will inject new momentum into the growth of China-EU relationship across the board and make new contribution to the building of China-EU partnership as a whole.", "2. London is one of the world's financial centers, and is keen to play an important role in China's financial development, whether by serving as an offshore trading hub for the renminbi or by possibly one day having a trading link between London and Shanghai stock exchanges. What role do you envision London playing in the modernization and globalization of the Chinese currency and stock markets?", "A: The reform and opening up of China's financial sector has made remarkable progress since China embarked on the path of reform and opening up 37 years ago. This has been especially obvious in the past several years. China will continue to adopt multiple measures to advance the reform and opening up of its financial sector so that its financial market can better adapt to financial modernization and globalization.", "As one of the global financial centers, London is an important pump station in the world economic lifeline, so to speak. Strengthened financial cooperation with London is definitely a win-win choice for both countries. China-UK financial cooperation started early. It has enjoyed rapid growth, has tremendous potential and leads China-UK cooperation in various areas. We have accomplished much in recent years. Our two countries signed the bilateral currency swap agreement. China set up an RMB clearing bank in London. The UK became the first country outside Asia to obtain the RQFII initial investment quota, the first Western country to issue RMB-denominated sovereign bond and the first major developed country to include RMB into its foreign exchange reserves. This is a highlight in our bilateral cooperation.", "Back in 2012, London officially launched the plan of Center of RMB Business. London has since then become one of the most dynamic and most important RMB trading centers and offshore RMB markets. In 2014, RMB trading in London grew by 143 percent year-on-year and its RMB deposits reached 20 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 37 percent.", "When conditions are in place, China is ready to consider strengthening the connectivity of the financial markets of the two countries. London can leverage its unique strengths in the financial field to get actively involved in the modernization and globalization of China' s financial market.", "3. Chinese companies are expected to take a stake in the nuclear power plant in southwest England. This is in line with plans announced by your government earlier this year to help Chinese firms in areas such as high-speed rail and nuclear power to expand overseas. What role do you hope to see Chinese companies playing in the global markets over the next decade? Do you think that opposition could derail China's participation in such projects overseas? Will such opposition lead to fresh trade frictions? Is such state-subsidized, state-directed expansion of Chinese industry abroad fair to other market players and in line with China's professed desire for a more market-driven economy?", "A: China is intensifying its reform and opening-up drive, which means both opening up its economy further to attract foreign investment and encourage Chinese firms to make overseas investment. This is natural when a country reaches a particular stage of development and when a company grows bigger, and this is what all big companies in the world are doing.", "Having benefited from the world economy, Chinese companies should contribute their share to world economic development. China has grown into a global manufacturing power, with particular strengths at the middle rung of the global industrial chain. Many Chinese industrial sectors and equipment making capacity, including the building of high-speed railway and nuclear power stations as well as automobiles making, are advanced and competitive internationally, and meet the demand and absorbing capacity of many countries. China is ready to pursue cooperation of various forms with the UK and other countries in international production capacity and equipment manufacturing to synergize our respective strengths and promote each other's development. The Hinkley Point is the product of tripartite cooperation among China, the UK and France. I hope that the companies of the three countries will fully leverage their respective strengths to ensure the successful launch of this project and deliver benefits to the British people.", "It is normal for a company to encounter various problems when making investment, whether domestically or overseas. When doing business, one should focus on business. Problems that occur in business operations should not be politicized, and Chinese companies should not be viewed with bias. Competition is necessary for a business to grow, and no one will give away a market to its rivals. We hope that such competition is benign and market-based. There should be no swing doors or glass doors which are placed as non-economic or non-market-based barriers. Unlike established multinational companies, Chinese companies still lack experience in making investment overseas. They need to better adapt to local laws and regulations, technological standards, marketing, human resources management rules, local cultures, etc. Chinese companies will learn a lot and emerge successful in fierce international competition.", "The Chinese government supports Chinese companies in going global. But we believe that this process should be market-oriented with companies being the main driver. The role of the Chinese government is to secure and create a favorable political environment and a fair legal framework for Chinese companies. This is what all governments are doing, and I think the Western countries are doing better than us. Even under market conditions, countries support the growth of their companies in various ways, and such measures should not be all labelled as government subsidy. China's system is different from that of Western countries. Due to historical reasons, Chinese companies perform many social functions, which are hard to measure with a simple arithmetic formula.", "In the coming decade, China's overseas investment will continue to grow and is forecast to reach 1.25 trillion U.S. dollars. This will provide more opportunities for China-UK cooperation. The Chinese and British companies may also engage in tripartite cooperation in developing countries to integrate the upper stream, middle stream and lower stream of the global value chain and share development opportunities.", "4. Britain was the first European country to sign up for membership of the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). China has promised that the new bank will be transparent and have high governance standards. How will China ensure that the AIIB really will be transparent and have world-class governance?", "A: China's initiative to establish the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank aims to promote infrastructure development and connectivity in Asia and boost regional cooperation.", "The AIIB is an international financial institution whose rules of operation are decided by its members through consultation, not by China alone. We agree that the AIIB should fully draw on the experience and practices of other multilateral development banks, observe high international standards in terms of governance structure, operation guidelines, and human resources management, and ensure its professional and efficient operation as well as transparency and integrity. During the negotiation over the AIIB agreement, 57 prospective founding members acted on the principle of openness, inclusion, professionalism and transparency, and concluded a high-quality agreement text. A total of 53 prospective founding members have signed the agreement.", "I know that this agreement has drawn on the practices of existing multilateral development banks in many ways. It has also made some breakthroughs and explored new ways of operation. For example, in terms of governance structure, AIIB has, with reference to the common practice of multilateral development banks, set up a three-tiered structure, consisting of a board of governors, a board of directors and a management team. It has also put in place an oversight mechanism in line with the principle of transparency, openness, independence and accountability. It is specified in the agreement that the management team will be selected through an open, transparent and merit-based process. This is a new principle not included in the constitution of existing major multilateral development banks. Another example is that the AIIB places no restriction on the procurement of goods and services from any country, and again this is not the case in the other regional multilateral development banks.", "The AIIB prospective founding members are working on the specific operation guidelines in accordance with the agreement. The relationship between the AIIB and existing multilateral development banks is a cooperative and complementary one. The AIIB will engage in cooperation with them in terms of sharing expertise, capacity building and joint financing.", "China commends and welcomes the UK joining into the AIIB. We are ready to work with the UK and all other prospective founding members to build the AIIB into a professional and efficient infrastructure financing platform to contribute to the development of Asia and beyond.", "5. China is playing an increasingly active role as a member of the international community, whether by helping bring peace to South Sudan or evacuating foreigners, including Britons, from the civil war in Yemen. As China's economic strength and world influence continue to grow, it needs to make more efforts to protect its rights and interests across the world. How do you see China's role in global affairs changing in the coming decade? Will it play a greater role in mediating conflicts? Will China one day replace the\u00a0United Statesas the world's policeman and protect its interests by establishing military bases around the world?", "A: China was, is and will continue to be a force for world peace, common development and international cooperation. With the increase of its overall strength, China will be able to play a more active role in international and regional affairs.", "At the summits commemorating the 70th anniversary of the UN this September, I announced on behalf the Chinese government a series of initiatives, which include: the establishment of an assistance fund for South-South cooperation with an initial pledge of 2 billion U.S. dollars; a ten-year, 1-billion-U.S. dollar China-UN peace and development fund; China joining the newly-established UN Peacekeeping Capability Readiness System and setting up a permanent peacekeeping police squad and a peacekeeping standby force of 8,000 troops; the provision of 100 million U.S. dollars in military aid to the African Union in the coming five years to support the building of African Standby Force and the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crisis.", "China has been stepping up efforts for world peace and development not because it wants to become a \"world cop\", even less to take anyone' s place. We are always of the view that a country's affairs should be decided by its own people and the world's affairs should be managed through consultation among the peoples of all countries. China upholds the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. It pursues common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. China follows the principle of non-interference in other country's internal affairs and believes that international and regional hot spots should be resolved by peaceful means. China has declared many times that it pursues adefence policy defensive in nature and will never seek hegemony, engage in expansion or impose its own will on others.", "6. China, the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitter, has pledged to bring its emissions to a peak by \"around 2030\" and has also said it would cut carbon intensity - the amount emitted per unit of economic output - by 60 to 65 percent below the 2005 level. As a developing country, China has stuck firmly to the principle that industrialized nations should bear most of the burden when it comes to cutting carbon emissions. Is China prepared to change any of its negotiating positions or offer further compromises in order to make sure that a new global climate change deal is secured in Paris later this year?", "A: Climate change is a global challenge at which no country can stand on their own. Developed and developing countries have different historical responsibilities for climate change, and different development needs and capabilities. Just like in a car race: it would be neither reasonable nor fair to apply the same speed requirements to cars which have run far ahead and those which have only just left the starting point. Developed countries should do more and lead the way in addressing climate change. This is in keeping with the important principles laid down in the UNFCCC, such as \"common but differentiated responsibilities\", equity and respective capabilities. This is also the hope of all developing countries.", "Having said that, the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" does not exempt developing countries from contributing their share to global response to climate change. It is only that such contribution should be in line with their capabilities and needs. China is now the world's biggest country in energy conservation and utilization of new and renewable energy. In 2014, China's per unit\u00a0GDP energy consumption and CO2 emission were cut by 29.9 percent and 33.8 percent respectively from the 2005 level. China's submission to the UN of its nationally intended contributions is aimed at facilitating global climate governance, and also for the sake of China's own development. It represents China's very best effort to help achieve the goals set in the UNFCCC. China has announced the setting up of an 20-billion-RMB yuan South-South cooperation fund on climate change to help other developing countries.", "The Paris Conference coming up at the end of this year is a significant milestone in the multilateral process on climate change, as it will set up post-2020 international regimes to tackle this challenge. Progress in negotiations requires flexibility of all parties, yet the basic principles of the UNFCCC need to be observed. Parties should demonstrate sincerity as much as they can, build up consensus and work toward the same goal. China is ready to play a constructive role and work for the timely conclusion of a comprehensive, balanced and strong agreement at the Paris conference.", "7. China is being increasingly assertive in pushing its territorial claims in the South China Sea, which has worried many of its neighbors. China also says it will not pursue hegemony and will unswervingly stick to the path of peaceful development. Do you understand why so many of China's neighbors doubt these claims? How do you respond to accusations that China's activities in the South China Sea could be worsening the security situation in the region? What is China's ultimate aim with its current activities in the South China Sea?", "A: To follow the path of peaceful development serves China's fundamental interests, and is also what regional countries and peoples expect from us. It is a strategic choice made by China that has not changed and will not change. For many years, China's active efforts for win-win cooperation with its neighbors have brought real benefits to countries and peoples in the region. Under the new circumstances, China will strive to deliver more benefits of its development to neighboring countries and peoples. China will continue to pursue friendship and partnership with its neighbors, build a harmonious, secure and prosperous neighborhood and follow through on its policy of amity, sincerity, mutual-benefit and inclusiveness towards its neighbors.", "The islands and reefs in the South China Sea are Chinese territory since ancient times. They are left to us by our ancestors. The Chinese people will not allow anyone to infringe on China's sovereignty and related rights and interests in the South China Sea. The actions China has taken in the South China Sea are legitimate reactions to safeguard its territorial sovereignty. Expansionism refers to laying claims to land outside one's own territory. China has never done anything like that, so such doubts or accusations are unwarranted.", "With the joint efforts of all parties, the situation in the South China Sea has on the whole been stable. The South China Sea provides important waterways for China's international commercial exchanges. China needs peace, security and stability in the South China Sea more than any other country. China would not want any turbulence there, still less would it be the party to stir up chaos. It is working hard to take forward consultations on a code of conduct in the South China Sea within the framework of fully and effectively implementing the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. China will continue to work with its neighbors in the South China Sea to manage disputes through institutionalized dialogue, peacefully resolve disputes through negotiation and consultation, actively explore win-win results through cooperation and joint development, and safeguard the freedom of navigation and overflight enjoyed by countries in accordance with international law. We will together endeavor to make the South China Sea a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation. And the efforts of countries in the region to maintain peace and stability there deserve more respect.", "8. China has asked for international help from countries including Britain to return corruption suspects who have fled overseas. Some of these countries have complained that China is reluctant to hand over the evidence needed for them to be able to process deportation orders in court. How will China improve its cooperation with foreign countries to get these suspects back?", "A: China's judicial departments would readily provide solid evidence on specific cases in international anti-corruption cooperation. China is a country with rule of law. It acts according to law and on the basis of facts both in fighting corruption within the country and carrying out international anti-corruption cooperation.", "In any country, corruption is most detested by the people. International cooperation in this area is aimed at bringing criminal suspects who have committed acts of corruption and absconded overseas back to China to face justice. China and the UK have maintained sound cooperation in jointly fighting corruption and concluded the treaty for mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, which has laid the legal foundation for jointly fighting corruption.", "In today's world, no country or place should provide shelter or even safe haven for corrupt elements and their proceeds of crime. What baffles the Chinese people the most is that some corrupt elements for whose crimes there are solid evidence should be able to stay at large in some countries and escape the punishment of the law by citing all kinds of excuses. Due to differences in legal systems between countries, some technical legal matters need to be worked through in international cooperation against corruption. This requires various parties to explore solutions together. In particular, anti-corruption and law enforcement agencies need to strengthen cooperation in investigation and information sharing on individual cases. I am convinced that as long as we have the political will to fight corruption, international cooperation in this field will surely yield more results.", "9. China's economy and its global impact are growing bigger and bigger. Policy-makers around the world all need to know about China's economic situation more than ever before. Your government has set a target of growing the economy by around 7 percent this year. However, the economic situation appears to have deteriorated in the last several months, and many investors and economists now see this target as highly unlikely to be reached, creating great concern in global financial and commodity markets. Do you expect to meet this target? What further measures do you stand ready to take in order to keep growth from slowing too much? How to maintain stability of China's financial market?", "A: The Chinese economy grew by 7 percent in the first half of this year, which is consistent with the growth target of the whole year and is the fastest growth rate among major economies around the world. It is normal that an economy may grow at different speeds in different periods. It would be against the law of economics to aim for ever higher growth without any slowing down. The 7 percent growth in the first half of this year was achieved on the basis of an economy of over 10 trillion U.S. dollars. The increment is already equivalent to the annual GDP of a medium-sized country and still exceeds what was generated by double-digit growth several years ago.", "As an economy closely linked to international markets, China cannot stay immune to the lackluster performance of the global economy. We do have concerns about the Chinese economy, and we are working hard to address them. We also worry about the sluggish world economy, which affects all countries, especially developing ones.", "Historian Dr. Arnold Toynbee believes that \"challenge and response\" is an important factor underpinning the development of human civilization. China's economic development is adjusting to the new normal and experiencing growing pains of shifting from old drivers of growth to new ones. Yet the fundamentals of a steadily growing economy have remained unchanged. The new type of industrialization, IT application, urbanization and agricultural modernization that is in full swing has generated strong domestic demand and great potential for future growth. It has also made the economy more resilient and adaptable. All this, coupled with deepening structural reforms, means that China will have very promising economic prospects.", "We are making coordinated efforts to promote steady growth, continued reform, structural adjustments, and higher living standards, and forestall economic risks. We will enhance macro regulation in creative ways to improve the quality and efficiency of economic development and address the lack of balance, coordination and sustainability in the economy. We will put more emphasis on innovation and consumption-driven growth. The policy on utilizing foreign investment remains unchanged. We will improve the rule of law in the commercial field, protect intellectual property rights, and promote fair competition. We will continue to promote the development of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and carry out international cooperation on production capacity. Both the Chinese economy and the world economy stand to benefit in this process.", "In the face of changes in the domestic and international financial markets, we have taken a number of steps including lowering the required reserve ratio and interest rates and improving the RMB exchange rate regime. These measures have helped to largely defuse risks and restore stability in the markets. Going forward, we will deepen market-oriented financial reforms according to law to cultivate an open and transparent capital market that enjoys long-term, stable and sound development. We will improve risk management, stabilize market expectations and make it easier for private capital to operate in the financial sector to better support the real economy.", "10. You have said that you hope one day China will be able to host the World Cup, and that one day China could win it. You care about the sport enough that you announced big reform plans for Chinese football earlier this year. Britain is the birthplace of modern football. Is there anything China can learn from Britain in raising the level of Chinese football, and making the Chinese football industry as successful as Britain's? What is your biggest hope for Chinese football?", "A: Football is the most popular sport in the world and there are over 100 million football fans in China alone. My greatest expectation on Chinese football is for the Chinese team to be one of the best in the world and for football to play an important role in making people stronger in body and mind. We will find a new way forward for the sport to flourish in China that is both consistent with the general pattern of football development and fits well with Chinese conditions. We will pursue the goals of strengthening football training for the youth, reforming the professional football system, enhancing international cooperation and boosting the football industry.", "The UK has a long and proud history of football and a wealth of experience in this sport. The Premier League is one of the most influential and successful professional football leagues in the world. China and the UK have had good cooperation on football in recent years. In 2012, a cooperation program was launched to promote football in schools and the UK started to train Chinese football coaches at the grassroots level. In 2013, the Premier League and the Chinese Super League signed a letter of intent on cooperation, and David Beckham was named \"ambassador for the youth football program in China and the Chinese Super League\" . Last month, the two countries signed an MOU to produce future stars in football. In the next five years, football training will be introduced to 20,000 Chinese schools, which means huge potential of cooperation between China and the UK in the training of players, coaches and referees.", "I am confident that Chinese football will do better and make its own contribution to world football.", "When doing business, one should focus on business.", "There should be no swing doors or glass doors which are placed as non-economic or non-market-based barriers.", "Debate over Chinese city's women-only bus", "The introduction of a women-only bus in one Chinese city has riled some local men and sparked an online debate.", "The new summer service will run during morning and evening rush hours in Zhengzhou, in an effort to cut the number of groping incidents, Dahe Daily reports. The local bus company says it'll protect women from being harassed when wearing lighter clothing, and also help breastfeeding mothers feel more comfortable.", "Female-only train and metro carriages have been introduced in many countries with varying degrees of success, but single-sex transport is a relatively new concept in China.", "Women interviewed on board the bus said they were pleased with the service, with one telling a reporter: \"Of course this is a good idea, it is very respectful to women.\"", "But some local men are less impressed. One tells Dahe Daily that harassment isn't common on public transport: \"The bus company has made a fuss over it - this measure will cause men to feel humiliated.\" Another man complains to China National Radio: \"I had to wait a really long time for another bus to arrive because I wasn't allowed on.\"", "A video that has gone viral shows an elderly man remonstrating with the driver after being denied boarding. \"You're discriminating against me! This is a public bus!\" he shouts. Others appear unfazed, and wander off in search of another service.", "It's become a hot topic of debate on microblogging site Weibo, with lots of women welcoming the idea, although one notes: \"Not all men are bad, but aren't all men being discriminated against here?\" There's support from male users too, although some think it promotes a general distrust of men.

The food, friends, and structure that you had relied on for four years are all immediately taken away from you. You are thrust into the world and tasked with the challenge of figuring out how to live on your own.", "There are any struggles that graduates face. Finding a job, finding a place to live, and figuring out how to pay the bills are just a few of the economic difficulties that alumni are forced to embrace and figure out. On a social level, graduates often need to establish a new network of friends and acquaintances. This is much more difficult than it was during the days when you could walk down your dorm hall and bump into a few friends.", "While post-college life can certainly have its struggles, there are many useful strategies to help make this transition as easy and painless as possible. Here are a few tips for recent graduates to think about as they make the transition into their adult life.", "1. Discover your passions", "Your early twenties are a time to take risks, try new things, and discover your passions. Don't worry so much about having a concrete plan, now is the time when you can experiment and find your true skills and interests. While making money immediately might seem important, your early twenties are one of the best times for exploring different career paths and planning out a roadmap for your future.", "2. Network", "Throughout your entire career, networking will be very important. One of the most important networking times in your career will be right after graduation. You are fresh in the job market, and you don't have a long resume of experience. Now is a time when connections will matter more than ever. One of the biggest benefits of being in college and being a recent graduate is that you have access to a gigantic network of like-minded people. Take advantage of your existing school network and reach out to people who went to your school. These don't have to be people you knew very well, or even people that you have much in common with. Simply having gone to the same school is usually enough of an affiliation to compel another fellow alumni to speak with you. Your alumni network is a natural resources which you can tap into to find job opportunities and connections.", "3. Be humble", "Humility is an important trait for recent college graduates. While it is important to have confidence when pursuing job opportunities, it is also important to stay humble. It is important to be aware that you don't have much experience, and to be willing to take a job that you are not fond of. Your goal as a college graduate isn't necessarily to find your dream job that will propel you into a successful future--it's just to find a job to help you get started. Most jobs will provide a lot of value for you, in terms of teaching you about the world, and teaching you what it means to have a full-time job. Don't underestimate the importance and value of learning from a company what life is like. Moreover, after graduation it is unlikely that you will know exactly what you want to do. Be willing to dive into a job that might not be a perfect fit, and learn from it.", "4. Take risks", "Your early twenties are the best time to take risks. When you are older with more responsibilities, taking risks will be much more difficult. When you are young with fewer responsibilities, however, it is easier to travel, try new things, and explore your options. Go with your gut, and be willing to take a leap. You are in a special time in your career that you might not be able to take advantage of in the future. If you have an inclination to take a risky job, move somewhere new, or deviate from your path--now is the time to do it. 20", "5.

Wanting a symbol for resistance to the Nazi occupation, he came up with the single letter \"V\", which stood not only for his own first name, but also for English victory, Flemish virijheid, and French victoire. The symbolism of the sign spread very quickly, and Winston Churchill used it constantly in public appearance. Thus throughout the 1940s and 1950s, the gesture meant simply \"victory\".\nV", "The second meaning came in the 1960s. Because of its military implication, American antiwar protestors used the sign sarcastically against the arms, so that it became known as the \"peace sign\". In the 1970s, the \"V\" sign, which had lost its military implication, was a common greeting among freedom lovers, acid heads, political radicals, and ultimately, young people in general. So by about the middle of the 1970s, it ceased to give clue to the user's philosophy.\nV", "The third meaning is the oldest and least common. American children jokingly put \"V\", which resembles \"horns\", behind friends' heads in group snapshot. They are unknowingly reproducing something that southern Europeans would find highly offensive. This mischief, called \"horns of the Devil\", is a variant of the European \"horns\" gesture, which is obscene. Here the \"V\" sign means \"Your wife has been cheating on you\" or, when placed behind another's head, \"His wife has been cheating on him.\nV", "In the United States, the gesture is typically given with the palm facing the viewer. The British use both this version and an older, palm-backward version; the latter is obscene in American culture, and corresponds to the American \"finger\". Churchill got some surprised stares in 1941 when, evidently unaware of the vulgar usage, he gave the palm-backward \"V\" to British troops. In England today you could have to be a social hermit not to understand the distinction.

Patients with low blood pressure, for instance, can easily go on a low-salt diet and still enjoy delicious food. And with the fork, there\u2019s absolutely no risk of over-salting your food. Luckily, the voltage is so small that there is no risk of electrocution either.", "The idea of adding electricity to food was first revealed as an experiment at the Computer Human Interaction Conference in Austin, Texas, in 2012.

He plays Jimmy, an Air Force soldier who learns of an experimental military project involving chimpanzees trained to operate flight simulators. The chimp at the center of the film, Virgil, is sent to the program after the research grant of his hottie caretaker (Hunt) is not renewed.

The Universal Animation Studios adaptation is overwhelmingly cute at times, but never unpleasantly so. Will Ferrell voices Ted -- yes, The Man in the Yellow hat gets a name. He also gets a love interest in Drew Barrymore's Maggie.

It's a more serious spin on the classic story of a boy lost in the jungle and raised by a family of apes. The 1984 film is also notable for the incredibly realistic apes -- even by today's standards -- created by effects guru Rick Baker.

The movie didn't earn Eastwood any cred with critics, in fact it was almost universally panned upon release, but it struck a chord with audiences, perhaps drawn in by the irony of the spaghetti western toughguy appearing in such a silly affair.

In the foreseeable future, a world war is unlikely, and the international situation is expected to remain generally peaceful. There are, however, new threats from hegemonism, power politics and neo-interventionism. International competition for the redistribution of power, rights and interests is tending to intensify.

China, as a large developing country, still faces multiple and complex security threats, as well as increasing external impediments and challenges.

On the issues concerning China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, some of its offshore neighbors take provocative actions and reinforce their military presence on China's reefs and islands that they have illegally occupied. Some external countries are also busy meddling in South China Sea affairs; a tiny few maintain constant close-in air and sea surveillance and reconnaissance against China. It is thus a long-standing task for China to safeguard its maritime rights and interests. Certain disputes over land territory are still smoldering.

Further, China faces a formidable task to maintain political security and social stability. Separatist forces for \"East Turkistan independence\" and \"Tibet independence\" have inflicted serious damage, particularly with escalating violent terrorist activities by \"East Turkistan independence\" forces. Besides, anti-China forces have never given up their attempt to instigate a \"color revolution\" in this country. Consequently, China faces more challenges in terms of national security and social stability. With the growth of China's national interests, its national security is more vulnerable to international and regional turmoil, terrorism, piracy, serious natural disasters and epidemics, and the security of overseas interests concerning energy and resources, strategic sea lines of communication (SLOCs), as well as institutions, personnel and assets abroad, has become an imminent issue.", "The world revolution in military affairs (RMA) is proceeding to a new stage.

It is a Chinese Dream of achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The Chinese Dream is to make the country strong. China's armed forces take their dream of making the military strong as part of the Chinese Dream. Without a strong military, a country can be neither safe nor strong.

In response to the new requirement arising from the changing security situation, the armed forces will constantly innovate strategic guidance and operational thoughts so as to ensure the capabilities of fighting and winning.

In 2011, they added another initiative that gave local communities funding to plant green space in vacant lots in whatever method they chose \u2014 lawns, community gardens, playgrounds and more.", "When Kondo and her team compared crime around these vegetation plots with undeveloped plots in nearby areas, they found the areas around new green spaces had lower crime rates than elsewhere in the city. Interestingly, the crime reduction was different depending upon the type of green space that was developed. For example, lots that were planted with grass and maintained by contractors saw a reduction in property crimes such as theft and burglary, whereas community-maintained plots saw a sharp reduction in violent crime. This suggests that different types of green space could be developed to deter certain types of crime.", "Kondo's study collaborates another forest service study conducted by researcher Morgan Grove on the link between lawn care and crime in downtown Baltimore. Grove's study looked at the level of lawn maintenance in 1,000 residential yards throughout Baltimore County. His team looked at everything from tree cover to litter to the presence of garden hoses. Not surprisingly, Grove found that well-maintained lawns were linked to lower crime rates than lawns that were given less care.", "It's tempting to use income as the connection. After all, if you have the time and money to water your lawn, you probably live in a neighborhood that sees less crime. But Grove argued that the greenery itself helped to deter crime, by announcing to would-be criminals that there are \"eyes on the street\" that care for their neighborhood and would be more likely to report a crime.", "The takeaway from these two studies is that urban green space may help to deter crime and could be a useful tool in city-wide crime prevention policies. We already know greenery is beautiful to look at and can help improve mood and health while reducing pollution. Now we can add crime-fighting to the list of vegetation's many benefits.", "8 ways cats say 'I love you'", "Unlike dogs, cats don't greet their owners with wagging tails and sloppy kisses, but that doesn't mean they don't have genuine affection for their human companions.", "Cats simply express their affection in more subtle ways, and all you need is a basic understanding of feline behavior and body language to see all the little ways your kitty says, \u201cI love you.\u201d", "1.

efforts the DPRK fully proved that the technological specifications of the newly developed H-bomb for the purpose of test were accurate and scientifically verified the power of smaller H-bomb.", "It was confirmed that the H-bomb test conducted in a safe and perfect manner had no adverse impact on the ecological environment.", "The test means a higher stage of the DPRK's development of nuclear force.", "By succeeding in the H-bomb test in the most perfect manner to be specially recorded in history the DPRK proudly joined the advanced ranks of nuclear weapons states possessed of even H-bomb and the Korean people came to demonstrate the spirit of the dignified nation equipped with the most powerful nuclear deterrent.", "This test is a measure for self-defence the DPRK has taken to firmly protect the sovereignty of the country and the vital right of the nation from the ever-growing nuclear threat and blackmail by the US-led hostile forces and to reliably safeguard the peace on the Korean Peninsula and regional security.", "Since the appearance of the word hostility in the world there has been no precedent of such deep-rooted, harsh and persistent policy as the hostile policy the US has pursued towards the DPRK.", "The US is a gang of cruel robbers which has worked hard to bring even a nuclear disaster to the DPRK, not content with having imposed the thrice-cursed and unheard-of political isolation, economic blockade and military pressure on it for the mere reason that it has differing ideology and social system and refuses to yield to the former's ambition for aggression.", "The Korean Peninsula and its vicinity are turning into the world's biggest hotspot where a nuclear war may break out since they have been constantly stormed with all nuclear strike means of the US imperialist aggressor troops, including nuclear carrier strike group and nuclear strategic flying corps.", "While kicking up all forms of economic sanctions and conspiratorial \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK with mobilization of the hostile forces, the US has made desperate efforts to block its building of a thriving nation and improvement of the people's living standard and \"bring down its social system\".", "The DPRK's access to H-bomb of justice, standing against the US, the chieftain of aggression watching for a chance for attack on it with huge nukes of various types, is the legitimate right of a sovereign state for self-defense and a very just step no one can slander.", "Genuine peace and security cannot be achieved through humiliating solicitation or compromise at the negotiating table.", "The present-day grim reality clearly proves once again the immutable truth that one's destiny should be defended by one's own efforts.", "Nothing is more foolish than dropping a hunting gun before herds of ferocious wolves.", "The spectacular success made by the DPRK in the H-bomb test this time is a great deed of history, a historic event of the national significance as it surely guarantees the eternal future of the nation.", "The DPRK is a genuine peace-loving state which has made all efforts to protect peace on the Korean Peninsula and security in the region from the US vicious nuclear war scenario.", "The DPRK, a responsible nuclear weapons state, will neither be the first to use nuclear weapons nor transfer relevant means and technology under any circumstances as already declared as long as the hostile forces for aggression do not encroach upon its sovereignty.", "There can neither be suspended nuclear development nor nuclear dismantlement on the part of the DPRK unless the US has rolled back its vicious hostile policy toward the former.", "The army and people of the DPRK will steadily escalate its nuclear deterrence of justice both in quality and quantity to reliably guarantee the future of the revolutionary cause of Juche for all ages.", "Juche Korea will be prosperous forever as it holds fast to the great WPK's line of simultaneously pushing forward the two fronts.", "And what were you planning on doing with this lizard, sir? The strangest items Brits have had confiscated at airport security", "Travelling through airport security can be a draining experience, with most travellers at one time or another forgetting that they

luggage.", "A recent survey of more than 2,000 Britons has revealed the top five strangest items confiscated at the airport and they include handcuffs and even live animals.", "The poll by flight comparison website JetCost showed many passengers like to try their luck with a bizarre range of mementos when returning home from vacation.", "Top of the list of items removed by security was handcuffs, with 14 per cent of respondents revealing the kinky bedroom accessory was the reason they had gotten into trouble with airport staff.", "Many claimed they had forgotten the item was in their hand luggage, but some admitted they were intending to use them during their plane journey.", "Second on the list was sand or foliage from the place the person had visited, with nine percent of respondents admitting their souvenir had fallen foul of security rules.", "Bizarrely, third on the list of items confiscated was living animals, with eight per cent of people admitting they'd had creatures including lizards and spiders removed from their hand luggage before boarding their flight.", "Rounding up the list were tent pegs at number four and dead animals, such as pheasants, at number five.", "The survey also questioned 1,000 residents of Spain, Italy, Germany and France to find out what were the most common items confiscated by people from those countries.", "In Spain, the most common item removed at security was cutlery, in Italy it was hair dye and in Germany it was dead animals.", "Meanwhile in France, the survey showed that locals were most likely to have fireworks

compelled to reach out to their exes after listening to 'Hello'.", "The results were compiled by the dating website WhatsYourPrice.com, which polled 41,000 single men and women.", "According to the same study, women are more open to discussing what went wrong in their relationships, while the majority of men prefer to simply move on with their lives.", "Brandon Wade, the founder and CEO of the

Here is the full transcript:", "1. Under your leadership, China has been active in promoting new economic and security arrangements. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, in particular, has been a notable achievement. Is China trying to rearrange the architecture of global governance, away from the U.S. and toward China?\n\u300a", "XI: The global governance system is built and shared by the world, not monopolized by a single country. China certainly has no intention to do so. China is involved in building the current international system, and has always done its part to uphold the international order and system with the U.N. as its core and the purposes and principles of the U.N. charter as its foundation.", "Many visionary people hold that as the global landscape evolves and major transnational and global challenges facing mankind increase, it is necessary to adjust and reform the global governance system and mechanism. Such reform is not about dismantling the existing system and creating a new one to replace it. Rather, it aims to improve the global governance system in an innovative way. We in China have a saying, \u201cWhen all means are exhausted, changes are necessary; once changes are made, things will improve.\u201d Whether for a country or the entire world, adaptation to keep pace with the times is necessary in order to maintain its vigor. To build a more equitable, just and effective architecture of global governance meets the common aspiration of all countries. China and the U.S. share broad interests in this respect and should work together to improve the global governance system. This will not only leverage our respective strengths to enhance cooperation, but also enable our two countries to jointly respond to major challenges facing mankind.", "China owes much of its progress in development over the past decades to international cooperation; we thus feel duty-bound to make greater contribution to international development endeavors. Many other developing countries have also expressed similar strong wishes to China. The Asian Infrastructure Development Bank (AIIB) is established mainly as a response to the need of Asian countries for infrastructure development and their aspirations for further cooperation. According to the projection of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, from 2010 to 2020, the annual shortfall in funding for Asian infrastructural development is around US$800 billion. The AIIB serves as a new option to meet this shortfall, and it is therefore welcomed by both Asian countries and the wider international community. But as the funding shortage is huge, it is clear that the AIIB alone cannot possibly meet such demand. As an open and inclusive multilateral development agency, the AIIB will complement other multilateral development banks. In addition to Asian countries, countries outside Asia such as Germany, France and the U.K. have also joined the AIIB. China welcomes the U.S. to join the AIIB. This has been our position from the very outset.", "I don't believe any country is capable of rearranging the architecture of global governance toward itself. Obviously, such practice goes against the trend of the times. The improvement of global governance architecture should be decided by all countries. As the U.N. summit commemorating the 70th anniversary draws nearer, China stands ready to work with all the other U.N. member states to build a new type of international relationship featuring win-win cooperation, improve the architecture of global governance, and build a community of shared future for mankind.", "2. China is playing an increasingly assertive role in regions around the world, from the Middle East to Africa and the Korean peninsula. Where do China's interests align or differ from the U.S.? What's China's view of the recent nuclear deal on Iran? How worried are you about North Korea's nuclear ambitions?\n \u300a", "XI:China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace and is committed to world peace and common development. In today's world, it is impossible for China to develop on its own; only when the world thrives can China prosper. China has never been absent in efforts to promote world economic recovery, seek political settlement of international and regional hotspots and respond to various global problems and challenges. This is what the international community expects of China, and to do so is China's responsibility.", "Both being permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China and the U.S. shoulder important responsibility of upholding regional and world peace and security, and our interests converge in a broad range of areas. China wishes to join hands with the U.S. to tackle major regional and global issues. As a matter of fact, we have done a great deal together in this area and will continue to do so. For example, China and the U.S. have been engaged in close coordination and cooperation in addressing various regional and international issues as well as global challenges, ranging from the Korean nuclear issue and the Iranian nuclear issue to Palestine-Israel peace talks, South Sudan, climate change and major epidemic diseases. Admittedly, there are differences in our respective thinking on and approach to some issues. However, differences are the reason why we should complement each other and find best solutions to issues.", "In addressing regional and international issues, China adheres to the principles of equality, fairness and justice and calls for seeking political settlement of relevant issues through peaceful negotiation. In addressing these issues, China bases its position and policy on the merit of each particular case and endeavors to uphold justice. China opposes arbitrary interference in other countries' internal affairs and stands for resolving issues through consultation. No matter how difficult and complex the challenges are, the international community should meet them with confidence and strive to resolve them through peaceful means.", "The political settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue represents a major achievement of the international community, and China and the U.S. worked hard to make this possible. It shows that our approaches have worked well. Going forward, China will work with all parties involved to ensure the deal is fully implemented.", "China's position for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is firm and clear-cut. At the same time, we believe that the denuclearization, peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula should be achieved through peaceful means. The current situation of the Korean Peninsula is intricate and sensitive. China will maintain close communication and coordination with the U.S. and relevant parties to properly address issues relating to the Korean Peninsula and ensure long-term stability of Northeast Asia.", "3. One of the first slogans you raised upon taking office was the \u201cChina Dream.\u201d It proved popular at home and has the ring of the \u201cAmerican dream.\u201d In speeches you've given, you've said the \u201cChina Dream\u201d is about building a strong nation and strong military. What do you see as the similarities and differences between the \u201cChina Dream\u201d and the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d?\n \u300a", "XI:\nThe Chinese dream is fundamentally about making life better for the Chinese people, and I think one should approach this concept from two angles: history and reality. Starting from the Opium War in 1840, the Chinese nation went through a century of social turbulence, foreign aggression and the sufferings of war. Yet throughout all this trying time, our people stood on their feet and struggled tenaciously for a better future. They never gave up the longing for their cherished dream. To understand today's China, one needs to fully appreciate the Chinese nation's deep suffering since modern times and the profound impact of such suffering on the Chinese minds. That is why we regard the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as its greatest dream since modern times. The Chinese dream is as much the dream of every Chinese as it is the dream of the whole nation. It is not an illusion, nor is it an empty slogan. The Chinese dream is deeply rooted in the hearts of the Chinese people.", "Every country and every nation has its own dream, and dream brings hope. During my last visit to the United States, my old friends in Muscatine, Iowa, talked to me about their dream. I have the impression that the Americans and people in all other countries share the same dream about the future: world peace, social security and stability, and a decent life. Naturally, owing to differences in history, culture and stage of development, China, the United States and other countries may not have the exact same dream, and they pursue their dreams in different ways. But all roads lead to Rome. The dreams of various peoples, however different in meaning, are sources of inspiration for them, and all these dreams create important opportunities for China and the United States, as well as other countries to engage in cooperation.", "4. Relations between the two countries are strained by many issues - from China's island-building in the South China Sea to allegations of cyber-spying and complaints by American businesses of unfair regulations. Some in the U.S. are even calling for a new containment policy against China. How do you answer these critics? What's the glue that holds U.S.-China relations together and how can it be made stronger?\n \u300a", "XI:In approaching China-U.S. relations, one should see the larger picture and not just focus on differences, just as a Chinese saying tells us, \u201cWhen important things are addressed first, secondary issues will not be difficult to settle.\u201d Together, China and the United States account for one-third of the world economy, one-fourth of the global population, and one-fifth of global trade. If two big countries like ours do not cooperate with each other, just imagine what will happen to the world. Both history and reality show that China and the United States stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. When President Obama and I met at the Annenberg Estate, California, in the summer of 2013, we made the strategic decision of jointly building a new model of major-country relationship between China and the United States featuring nonconflict or confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. In the past two years and more since then, guided by this agreement, our exchanges and cooperation across the board have kept deepening and been upgraded. We maintain close and effective dialogue and cooperation on almost all major international and regional issues and global challenges. Facts have shown that the interests of China and the U.S. have grown increasingly intertwined. The growth of the China-U.S. relationship has not only benefited our two peoples, it has also enhanced peace, stability and development in the Asia-Pacific and beyond.", "Naturally, we have some differences, even family members don't always see eye to eye with each other. Our two countries should understand and respect each other, expand common ground and properly handle differences, and respect and accommodate each other's core interests and major concerns. On issues that can be resolved, the two sides should make joint efforts to seek a solution; as to those issues that cannot be resolved for the time being, we should manage them in a constructive way, make sure that they are not exacerbated or escalated, and prevent them from derailing the overall relationship of the two countries and cooperation that has served our two peoples so well.", "The Nansha Islands have been China's territory since ancient times. This is fully backed by historical and legal evidence. China's development and maintenance of facilities on some of our garrisoned islands and reefs in the Nansha Islands does not impact on or target any other country, and it should not be overinterpreted. These facilities have been built to improve the working and living conditions of the Chinese personnel on the maritime features, provide international public goods and services, and better uphold navigation freedom and safety in the South China Sea.", "Chinatakes cybersecurity very seriously. China is also a victim of hacking. The Chinese government does not engage in theft of commercial secrets in any form, nor does it encourage or support Chinese companies to engage in such practices in any way. Cybertheft of commercial secrets and hacking attacks against government networks are both illegal; such acts are criminal offenses and should be punished according to law and relevant international conventions. China and the United States share common concerns on cybersecurity. We are ready to strengthen cooperation with the U.S. side on this issue.", "I will have in-depth exchanges of views with President Obama on bilateral relations and the international developments and engage the American public in order to jointly chart the course for growing China-U.S. relations. I am sure that this visit will send a positive message to the international community that China and the United States will strengthen cooperation and jointly meet global challenges.", "5. The expansion of China's military power and military operations has caused concern in Washington and unsettled some governments in the region. Please explain China's intentions. Does the U.S. alliance structure in Asia make Beijing feel less secure? Should Washington do more to accommodate Chinese security interests?\n \u300a", "XI:China has always pursued a defense policy that is defensive in nature and a military strategy featuring active defense. In strengthening our defense and military building, we are not going after some kind of military adventure. It never crosses our mind. China has no military base in Asia and stations no troops outside its borders. China is a big country that has vast territorial land, sea and airspace and very long borders. We need to maintain proper investment in our defense and keep the troop size at an appropriate level. To demonstrate China's determination to uphold peace and development, I announced not long ago a troop cut by 300,000. China has long pledged never to practice expansionism and seek hegemony. History has and will continue to prove this.", "Chinahas contributed more U.N. peacekeepers than any other permanent member of the Security Council. The Chinese military has played important roles in antipiracy escort operation in the Gulf of Aden and in the shipping of chemical weapons out of Syria for destruction. In our neighborhood, China's military has helped many countries to deal with natural disasters. It will do still more within its capacity to provide public security goods to the international community.", "Both China and the United States are major Asia-Pacific countries, whose interests intersect more closely and interact more frequently than in any other region of the world. Both sides desire to see peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific, as it serves their common interests as well as those of the countries in the region. The Asia-Pacific should be a cooperative ground for enhanced China-U.S. coordination and collaboration rather than their Coliseum for supremacy. Our attitude is this: we welcome whatever that contributes to regional peace and stability, and oppose whatever that may lead to conflict and turmoil in the region.", "In the Asia-Pacific, both China and the United States should vigorously implement the principles of mutual respect and win-win cooperation. China participated in RIMPAC for the first time in 2014. The two militaries are stepping up the two Confidence-Building Mechanisms. We hope to identify still more converging ground in the region for the two countries, continuously build up strategic trust and work with other countries in making the region more peaceful, stable and prosperous.", "6. China has had a tumultuous summer, with plummeting stock markets, a devaluation of the renminbi and signs of economic weakness. Many investors around the world wonder if the Chinese economy is weaker than the official figures show and if the government is sufficiently in control. What's your assessment of the economy and what is being done to shore up confidence among Chinese and global investors?\n \u300a", "XI:\nChina's economic growth is still one of the fastest in the world. In the first half of the year, the Chinese economy grew by 7%, which is hard-won considering the intricacy and changeable nature of the overall global economy. A growth rate of around 7% would be sufficient to reach our goal of doubling the 2010 GOP and per capita income by 2020.", "The Chinese economy is still operating within the proper range. What China needs is a higher quality and efficiency of economic development by successfully addressing the problem of unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable development, so that our economy will be put on a more solid basis and go forward more steadily. We are stepping up efforts to shift our growth model, make structural adjustment and place greater emphasis on developing an innovation and consumption-driven economy. It is our hope that by solving these problems, China's economy will transform itself and retain its robust dynamism for development.", "Against the overall global economic backdrop, many countries have encountered difficulties. The Chinese economy is also under a downward pressure. But it is a problem in the course of progress. What I want to emphasize, in particular, is that whatever happens, China will stay strongly committed to deepening its reform on all fronts while opening still wider to the outside world. We will work in a coordinated fashion to ensure growth, promote reform, make structural adjustment, improve people's well-being and forestall risks, enhancing and innovating macro-regulation and ensuring steady and fairly rapid economic development. With China steadily promoting a new type of industrialization, IT application, urbanization and agricultural modernization, its household savings rate being so high and consumer spending enjoying a huge potential plus its diligent workforce, its rising middle-income population, its robust service sector and its vast and potential-rich market, China has the capacity and is in the position to maintain a medium-high growth in the years to come.", "To understand China's economy, one needs to take a longer view. If you liken it to a large ship on the sea, the question you ask is whether it is sailing in the right direction, does it have sufficient engine power and energy to stay long. Any ship, however large, may occasionally get unstable sailing on the high sea. Investors will come to a right judgment if they have a full understanding of China's progress in economic development since the start of reform and opening-up, of China's strategies formulated recently to ensure sustained and steady growth, and of the relevant data and trends in China's economic performance. The report released by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai showed that 95% of the surveyed businesses have planned to increase or maintain their investment in China. That is a decision made by over 300 American entrepreneurs, a decision I believe all smart investors will make.", "7. Early on your leadership laid out an ambitious program for reform, promising to let markets play a \u201cdecisive\u201d role. The stock market rescue this summer, however, has raised questions about your leadership's commitment to economic reform. Why did you think it necessary to intervene in the stock markets? What significant economic reforms lay ahead over the coming months and year? People's Daily and other state media have reported on resistance to reform; where does the opposition come from?\n \u300a", "XI:An important goal for China's current economic reform is to enable the market to play the decisive role in resource allocation and make the government better play its role. That means we need to make good use of both the invisible hand and the visible hand.", "The ups and downs of stock markets are caused by the very nature of such markets, and the government normally does not intervene. The role of the government is to maintain an open, fair and impartial market order, protect the lawful rights and interests of investors, especially small- and medium-scale investors, promote the stable growth of the stock market in the long run, and defuse massive panic. The recent unusual fluctuations in the Chinese stock market were mainly the result of previous rapid surges and big fluctuations in the international market. The Chinese government has taken some measures to defuse systemic risks. Such steps have proved successful. As a matter of fact, similar steps have also been taken in some mature foreign markets. Thanks to a mix of stabilizing steps taken, the market has entered a stage of self-correction and adjustment. To develop the capital market is a key goal of China's reform, which will not change just because of current market fluctuations.", "In 2014, we advanced reform in various areas in a fast yet steady manner, and 80 major reform tasks were basically completed. On top of that, the relevant government departments completed 108 reform tasks, with 370 reform outcomes delivered in various sectors. Since the beginning of this year, we have introduced over 70 major reform plans. On Sept. 15, we discussed and adopted a number of reform plans, including the implementation of a system of negative list on market access, policies to support the development and opening-up of key border regions, a decision to accelerate the improvement of the pricing mechanism, and a plan to encourage the injection of non-state capital in investment projects launched by state-owned enterprises in accordance with due procedures. This year, we have decided to launch over 100 key reform steps, and more major economic reform steps will be introduced. Those items of reform that facilitate growth, structural adjustment, people's well-being and risk prevention will be prioritized. And substantive reform plans will be vigorously implemented in such areas as fiscal policy and taxation, finance, opening-up, the judiciary and people's well-being.\n\n2014", "This round of reform in China is comprehensive in nature and it is being pursued with unprecedented intensity. We have made enormous efforts and managed to overcome some long-standing obstacles. These reform steps have upset the vested interests of some people, and caused changes to the career and life of some people. It is only natural that there will be difficulties. Otherwise it will not be a reform. That is why I said that we must be bold enough to crack hard nuts and ford dangerous rapids during reform and that only the daring will prevail at key stages of reform. At the same time, reform calls for down-to-earth efforts. To set unrealistic expectations, play to public opinion by talking big or just scratch the surface will not work. Like an arrow shot that cannot be brought back, we will forge ahead against all odds to meet our goals of reform.", "8. Your government is engaged with the International Monetary Fund to have the RMB included in the official basket of reserve currencies. The devaluation in August was seen as a step toward a more flexible exchange rate, but also spooked global markets. Will China fully open its capital account to make the yuan a free convertible currency? How concerned are you about declines in China's foreign currency reserves and capital flight?\n \u300a", "XI:China has been working to improve market-based RMB exchange rate regime. Recent measures to improve the quotation of the RMB central parity is a case in point, as it gives greater say to the market in deciding the exchange rate. Given the complexities in the current international economic scene and financial market and the apparent divergence in market makers' expectations of the future trend of the RMB exchange rate, there had been a long-standing gap between the central parity and market exchange rate of the RMB. With improvements to the quotation of the RMB central parity, the RMB central parity will better respond to supply and demand in the foreign exchange markets, and systemically avert the sustained large gap between the RMB central parity and market exchange rate. Since the quotation of RMB central parity was improved on Aug. 11, initial progress has been made in correcting the deviation. Given the current economic and financial conditions at home and abroad, there is no basis for sustained depreciation of the RMB. Reform of the RMB exchange rate formation regime will continue in the direction of market operation.", "Chinaput forward the goal of convertibility of the RMB under the capital account back in the early 1990s. Over the past 20 years and more, China has been working toward this goal. Currently, there are only very few transactions that are still banned under the RMB capital account. China is advancing the convertibility of the RMB under the capital account in a steady and orderly manner.", "There has been a recent drop in China's foreign reserves. This actually reflects improvement to the mix of local currency as well as foreign exchange assets and liabilities of domestic banks, enterprises and individuals. There are three main reasons: First, some assets in foreign exchanges were transferred from the central bank to domestic banks, enterprises and individuals, including an increase of US$56.9 billion in the balance of foreign reserve deposits of domestic banks in the first eight months of this year, with a US$27 billion increase in August alone. Second, outbound investment by domestic enterprises has grown rapidly. Third, domestic enterprises and other market entities are reducing foreign financing steadily, which helps reduce risks of high leverage operation and currency mismatch. These changes are normal capital flow, which is moderate and manageable. Foreign investors who aim at long-term gains are still investing in China. China's foreign exchange reserves remain abundant and is still very large by international standard. With improvement to the RMB exchange rate regime and progress in RMB internationalization, it is quite normal that China's foreign reserves may increase or decrease, and there is no need to overreact to it.", "9. Many U.S. and other foreign companies that are invested heavily in China say that the business climate has changed and that they are subject to unfair regulation that favors Chinese competitors. U.S. business groups say companies that provide information technology like Cisco are being particularly targeted. What's your response to that? What do you expect from foreign companies?

Such policy will not change. Nor will our protection of the lawful rights and interests of foreign companies in China, and our commitment to better services in favor of foreign companies in China.

We give equal and fair treatment to all market players, including foreign-invested companies in China, and welcome all forms of cooperation between transnational corporations and their Chinese counterparts. In recent years, China has taken a series of investment facilitation steps, significantly cancelling restrictive items and adopting a management model based on pre-establishment national treatment plus negative list approach. By so doing, we aim to timely address the legitimate concerns of foreign investors, protect their lawful rights and interests, and foster a level playing field with open and transparent laws and policies, along with a more efficient administration.", "According to surveys by the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) and other authoritative international bodies, China remains the world's most attractive investment destination. Claims about a changing investment climate in China and foreign investors losing confidence in China are not backed by facts. In 2014, China received US$120 billion in foreign investment, more than any other country, and continued to be the leading destination among the developing countries for 23 years running. In the first eight months of this year, the actual amount of foreign investment used by China totaled US$85.3 billion, up by 9% from the corresponding period of the previous year. China will further ease market access for foreign investment. At the same time, we will improve regulations on foreign investment, amend relevant laws and better protect the lawful rights and interests of foreign investment in China.", "It is my hope that other countries will keep their markets open to Chinese investors.

The Party does not operate in a vacuum, so it has unavoidably found itself with problems of one kind or another. Corruption is just such a persistent one. The Party must be courageous enough to face up to the problem and go out to correct it through self-purification and self-rectification. Our people hate corruption more than anything else and we must act to allay their concerns. Therefore, we decided to go after both \u201ctigers and flies,\u201d wrongdoers regardless of their ranks.

The first is that we must keep power in the cage of systemic checks. The other one is, transparency is the best precaution against corruption. As we go further in the anticorruption campaign, we will focus more on institutional building so that officials will not dare and cannot afford to be corrupt and, more importantly, have no desire to take that course. Right now, we are formulating and updating relevant laws and regulations to truly put power inside a more closely-knit cage of effective checks. With respect to asset disclosure by officials, we adopted relevant regulations back in 2010 to require such reporting which was subject to random check and verification every year. The proportion of verified reporting has increased steadily, and no one would take exception.

Every civilization, distinct and colorful as it is, possesses the value for its existence. A country or a nation should cherish and protect its own culture and values, and at the same time, recognize and respect those of others.

Whereas several Dutch cities will introduce basic income next year and Switzerland is holding a referendum on the subject, there is strongest political and public support for the idea in Finland.", "A poll commissioned by the government agency planning the proposal, the Finnish Social Insurance Institution or KELA, showed that 69% support (link in Finnish) a basic income plan.

Finland\u2019s unemployment rate is at a 15-year high, at 9.53% and a basic income would allow people to take on low-paying jobs without personal cost. At the moment, a temporary job results in lower welfare benefits, which can lead to an overall drop in income.", "Previous experiments have shown that universal basic income can have a positive effect. Everyone in the Canadian town of Dauphin was given a stipend from 1974 to 1979, and though there was a drop in working hours, this was mainly because men spent more time in school and women took longer maternity leaves. Meanwhile, when thousands of unemployed people in Uganda were given unsupervised grants of twice their monthly income, working hours increased by 17% and earnings increased by 38%.", "One of the major downsides, of course, is the cost of handing out money to so many people.

But, as Bloomberg calculated, giving \u20ac800 of basic income to the population of 5.4 million every month would cost \u20ac52.2 billion a year. Finland only plans to give the basic income to adults, not every citizen, but with around 4.9 million adults in Finland, this would still cost \u20ac46.7 billion per year. The government expects to have \u20ac49.1 billion in revenue in 2016.", "Another serious consideration is that some people may be worse off under the plan. As the proposal hasn\u2019t been published yet, it\u2019s not yet known exactly who will lose out. But those who currently receive housing support or disability benefits could conceivably end up with less under national basic income, since the plan calls for scrapping existing benefits. And as national basic income would only give a monthly allowance to adults, a single mother of three could struggle to support herself compared to, for example, a neighbor with the same government support but no children and a part-time job.", "Finally, the proposal raises the question of whether it\u2019s really fair to give a relatively better off individual the same amount of welfare as someone who\u2019s truly struggling. Finland\u2019s constitution insists that all citizens must be equal, though, of course, equality can be interpreted in many different ways.
