In the past six decades since the founding of new China, and particularly in the past three decades since reform and opening-up, China has undergone enormous changes, and grown into one of world\u2019s major economies. On the other hand, China remains a huge developing country with the world\u2019s largest population. Its per capita GDP is just over US$7,600, lower than the world\u2019s average of US$10,000 and ranking behind the 80th place in the world. There is still imbalance in the development of rural and urban areas and among regions. As you can see, Beijing, Shanghai and some coastal cities in Eastern China are quite modern. But many places in Central and Western China are still underdeveloped. According to China\u2019s own standards, more than 70 million Chinese are still living in poverty. China remains the world\u2019s largest developing country, and Asia and Africa are home to the largest number of developing countries in the world. Growing the economyand improving people\u2019s lives is a common task facing China and other countries in Asia and Africa.

The international communityshould hold high the banner of free trade, oppose protectionism, refrain from trade wars, observeinternational trade laws and the basic principles of the World Trade Organization, uphold and improve the international financial system and build a more balanced and inclusive global trade regime. At the same time, trade and investment liberalization and facilitation should also be promoted at the regional level to complement and reinforce the global system, thus supporting global growth with two wheels. With Asian and African countries both at a crucial stage of industrialization and urbanization and a communityof shared interests emerging, active efforts should be made to carry out South-South and North-South cooperation. It\u2019s just like the dragon boat race during China\u2019s traditional Dragon Boat Festival.

No country can stay immune to challenges such as climate change, terrorism, cybersecurity, pandemicdiseases and natural disasters. Given our vulnerability to such threats, countries in Asia and Africa must come together and coordinate our response. On tackling climate change, every country must do its part. We must uphold the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and work for a fair and equitable post-2020 agreementon emission reduction. Terrorism is a global scourge. Whatever its form, it must be dealt with through joint efforts. Cyberspace is a new frontier for human society. We need to narrow the digital gap and develop an order in cyberspace based on peace, security, openness and cooperation. Epidemics respect no borders. All countries have a stake in the prevention and control of such diseases. Financial and medical assistance from China has contributed to the joint fight against recent epidemics such as the Ebola outbreak. China stands ready to continue to provide assistance to African countries most heavily affected by the epidemic to the best of its ability. China will continue to work with other Asian and African countries to help each other in times of need and together overcome non-traditional security threats and challenges.", "\u7b2c\u4e94\uff0c\u79ef\u6781\u6df1\u5316\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u6cbb\u4ea4\u6d41\u5408\u4f5c\u3002\u826f\u6cd5\u662f\u5584\u6cbb\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5730\u7403\u6751\u91cc\u9700\u8981\u7528\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u6765\u660e\u8fa8\u662f\u975e\u3001\u5b9a\u5206\u6b62\u4e89\u3002\u4e9a\u975e\u56fd\u5bb6\u8981\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u6cbb\u9886\u57df\u591a\u4ea4\u6d41\u3001\u591a\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u79ef\u6781\u53c2\u4e0e\u56fd\u9645\u7acb\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u66f4\u5145\u5206\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u8bc9\u6c42\u548c\u5171\u540c\u5229\u76ca\u3002\u8981\u5207\u5b9e\u7ef4\u62a4\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u7684\u6743\u5a01\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u8981\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u6df1\u5316\u4e9a\u975e\u56fd\u5bb6\u53f8\u6cd5\u6267\u6cd5\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u6253\u51fb\u8d70\u79c1\u3001\u6bd2\u54c1\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u8bc8\u9a97\u7b49\u8de8\u56fd\u72af\u7f6a\uff0c\u52a0\u5f3a\u53cd\u8150\u8d25\u56fd\u9645\u534f\u4f5c\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u79ef\u6781\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u5efa\u8bbe\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u6cbb\uff0c\u5df2\u52a0\u5165400\u591a\u9879\u591a\u8fb9\u6761\u7ea6\uff0c\u7f14\u7ed3\u4e862\u4e07\u591a\u9879\u53cc\u8fb9\u6761\u7ea6\u3002\u5949\u884c\u548c\u5e73\u5171\u5904\u4e94\u9879\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u575a\u6301\u4f9d\u6cd5\u529e\u4e8b\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u5916\u4ea4\u7684\u57fa\u77f3\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5728\u52a0\u5feb\u56fd\u5185\u6cd5\u6cbb\u5efa\u8bbe\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u6cbb\u8fdb\u7a0b\u4f5c\u51fa\u5e94\u6709\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002Fifth, we need to deepen exchanges and cooperation on the international legal system. Good laws are the foundation of sound governance. In our global village, international law is crucial to telling right from wrong and mitigating differences and conflicts. Asian and African countries need to increase exchanges and coordination on international rule of law and stay involved in international law-making to better reflect the aspirations and interests of developing countries. The authority and effectiveness of international law must be upheld. Asian and African countries need to, under the framework of international law, deepen judicial and law enforcement cooperation, jointly fight against smuggling, drug trafficking, financial fraud and other trans-national crimes and strengthen international cooperation to combat corruption. China is an active contributor to international rule of law. It has acceded to more than 400 multilateral treaties and concluded over 20,000 bilateral treaties. Commitment to the five principles of peaceful coexistence and to international law in general has been a cornerstone and defining feature of China\u2019s foreignpolicy.

Going forward, we hope to see more exchanges between member states to help build consensus and allow this valuable platform to flourish and serve its cause.
