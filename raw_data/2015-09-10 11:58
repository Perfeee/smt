The overall trend is positive, yet there are also difficulties to overcome. We are pressing ahead with structural reform to advance structural adjustment.

This has happened this year, last year and the year before last as well. The economy is still running within the proper range. We will stick to the basic orientation of our macroeconomic policy. We will continue to advance reform and opening-up, and promote structural adjustment.

Now we can say that we have successfully forestalled potential systemic financial risks. This is not to replace or weaken the role of the market. What we did is common international practice and is in keeping with China's national conditions.

As many currencies significantly depreciated against the dollar recently, developments on the international markets compelled us to adjust the quotation regime of the RMB central parity. Yet it was a small adjustment. Overall, the REER of the yuan has appreciated by a large margin during the term of this government. The truth is, after the small adjustment, the RMB exchange rate is now basically stable. There is no basis for continued depreciation of the RMB, because the Chinese economy has been operating within the proper range, we have ample foreign exchange reserves, and surplus of trade in goods has been rising. All these show that the RMB exchange rate can stay basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level.

This is not in keeping with our policy of structural adjustment. Still less do we want to see a global \"currency war\". As the Chinese economy has become so highly integrated into the global economy, a \"currency war\" would only bring more harm than good to China. As a matter of fact, after the small adjustment of the exchange rate, I once talked about this with relevant departments and some export-oriented firms in China. They said they hope the RMB exchange rate will remain basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level. Should there be market expectations of continued depreciation of the yuan, these companies could hardly get any long-term export order.

Between January and August this year, China imported 220 million tons of crude oil, up by 10% over the previous year. Soy bean imports rose by 7%, and iron ore imports were over 600 million tons, more or less the same as last year. However, commodity prices have dropped significantly, with some plunging 40-50%. We have been affected as a result. There were less tariffs and hence the strains on China's public finance. But commodity prices are not something for us to decide. Total import volume has not declined, yet the value of imports has come down as a result of falling prices. Who should be held accountable for this? It is a topic that can be further discussed and debated. If international commodity prices rebound, we would get more import tariffs. This would mean more public money to spend on improving people's lives. There would be change in the PPI too, which is beneficial for improving corporate profitability and performance.

But in specific areas, there have been new steps taken or new measures introduced. These steps have opened more areas to foreign investors and will help China attract more foreign investment. For example, the number of items where restrictions were imposed on foreign investment access has been slashed by 50%. We are also taking steps to facilitate foreign investment. We have replaced past practice of comprehensive review and approval with the practice of record keeping. The number of items requiring government approval only accounts for 5% of the total. We are promoting a management model based on pre-establishment national treatment and a negative list approach. We are conducting BIT reviews with the United States and the European Union, and FTA negotiations with many countries. Foreign investment will be able to get into more areas in an easier way in China. We are also becoming more capable of attracting foreign direct investment.
