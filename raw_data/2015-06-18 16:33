But through candid and practical consultations, Australia finally agreed to open its services sector in a negative-list approach, while China, based on its WTO accession commitments, will open part of its services sector in a positive-list approach and commit to adopting a negative-list approach in future negotiations with Australia in this area.\u4e2d\u6fb3\u81ea\u8d38\u534f\u5b9a\u5728\u8bf8\u591a\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u52a1\u5b9e\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u4ee5\u670d\u52a1\u8d38\u6613\u8fd9\u4e00\u56fd\u9645\u7ecf\u8d38\u8c08\u5224\u96be\u70b9\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e24\u56fd\u7ba1\u7406\u4f53\u5236\u5927\u76f8\u5f84\u5ead\uff0c\u5f7c\u6b64\u5404\u6709\u6838\u5fc3\u5173\u5207\u3002\u4f46\u4e2d\u6fb3\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5766\u8bda\u3001\u52a1\u5b9e\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u6fb3\u65b9\u6700\u7ec8\u540c\u610f\u5bf9\u4e2d\u65b9\u4ee5\u8d1f\u9762\u6e05\u5355\u65b9\u5f0f\u5f00\u653e\u670d\u52a1\u90e8\u95e8\uff0c\u4e2d\u65b9\u5219\u5728\u5165\u4e16\u627f\u8bfa\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b63\u9762\u6e05\u5355\u65b9\u5f0f\u5411\u6fb3\u65b9\u5f00\u653e\u90e8\u5206\u670d\u52a1\u90e8\u95e8\uff0c\u5e76\u627f\u8bfa\u5728\u672a\u6765\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1f\u9762\u6e05\u5355\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u6fb3\u65b9\u5f00\u5c55\u670d\u52a1\u8d38\u6613\u8c08\u5224\u3002", "China-Australia FTA is a major step towards Asia-Pacific economic integration. The 22nd APEC Economic Leaders Meeting in 2014 decided to launch the process of building the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area (APFTA). It requires the concerted efforts of all parties to fulfill this vision. Now a free trade agreement has been signed between two major economies - China and Australia, and the two sides have agreed to jointly explore the further opening of the services sector by adopting a negative-list approach. It is the shared belief of the two countries that China-Australia FTA, once upgraded, will be a strong boost to the development of high-level economic and trade arrangement in the Asia-Pacific region, and play a leading and demonstration role in the further opening up of the region.\u4e2d\u6fb3\u81ea\u8d38\u534f\u5b9a\u662f\u4e9a\u592a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u8fdb\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u30022014\u5e74\u4e9a\u592a\u7ecf\u5408\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5341\u4e8c\u6b21\u9886\u5bfc\u4eba\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u4f1a\u8bae\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u542f\u52a8\u4e9a\u592a\u81ea\u8d38\u533a\u8fdb\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u613f\u666f\u9700\u8981\u5404\u65b9\u5171\u540c\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u4e2d\u6fb3\u4e24\u5927\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u81ea\u8d38\u534f\u5b9a\uff0c\u53cc\u65b9\u8fd8\u7ea6\u5b9a\u672a\u6765\u4ee5\u201c\u8d1f\u9762\u6e05\u5355\u201d\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u63a2\u8ba8\u670d\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u5347\u7ea7\u3002\u76f8\u4fe1\u4e2d\u6fb3\u81ea\u8d38\u534f\u5b9a\u7684\u201c\u5347\u7ea7\u7248\u201d\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u529b\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e9a\u592a\u5730\u533a\u53d1\u5c55\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u7ecf\u8d38\u5b89\u6392\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u52a8\u672c\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f00\u653e\u53d1\u6325\u5f15\u9886\u548c\u793a\u8303\u6548\u5e94\u3002"], "chinese_title": "\u628a\u63e1\u4e2d\u6fb3\u81ea\u8d38\u534f\u5b9a\u5386\u53f2\u673a\u9047", "english_title": "Seize historic chance in China-Australia FTA", "time": "2015-06-18 16:33"}
