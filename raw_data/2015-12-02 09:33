The advert has been running since 16 November as part of the \"Smoking is a Disease\" campaign. But it has riled the country's largest smokers' group, an online community called I Love Smoking, which has previously challenged government policies in court. \u636e\u300a\u97e9\u56fd\u65f6\u62a5\u300b\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u536b\u751f\u90e8\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u8fd9\u4efd44\u79d2\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u8d70\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u9999\u70df\u4ead\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u70b9\u67d0\u4e2a\u724c\u5b50\u7684\u9999\u70df\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8981\u6c42\u552e\u8d27\u5458\u7ed9\u4ed6\u4eec\u6765\u4e00\u4efd\u91cd\u5927\u75be\u75c5\u3002\u201c\u7ed9\u6211\u80ba\u764c\uff0c\u201d\u4e00\u4e2a\u987e\u5ba2\u62a2\u5728\u552e\u8d27\u5458\u9012\u8fc7\u6765\u4e00\u5305\u9999\u70df\u524d\u8bf4\u9053\u3002\u97e9\u56fd\u53d1\u8d77\u4e86\u201c\u5438\u70df\u6709\u5bb3\u5065\u5eb7\u201d\u5ba3\u4f20\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u8be5\u5e7f\u544a\u4e5f\u662f\u76f8\u5173\u4e3e\u63aa\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u81ea11\u670816\u65e5\u8d77\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u64ad\u653e\u3002\u4f46\u5b83\u5374\u60f9\u607c\u4e86\u8be5\u56fd\u6700\u5927\u7684\u5438\u70df\u8005\u7fa4\u4f53\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u53eb\u201c\u6211\u7231\u5438\u70df\u201d\u7684\u7f51\u4e0a\u793e\u533a\u3002\u8be5\u56e2\u4f53\u6b64\u524d\u66fe\u5411\u6cd5\u9662\u8d77\u8bc9\u653f\u5e9c\u76f8\u5173\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "\"The ministry's video has clearly crossed the line,\" the group says in a statement, noting that the government earns a huge amount of tax revenue from tobacco products. \"If smoking is a disease, drinking is a disease because it causes liver problems and eating fast food is also a disease as it brings about obesity,\" it says. \"It is a jump of logic and discriminates against smokers.\" The group wants the advert to be pulled, and is planning a protest in front of the Ministry of Health.
